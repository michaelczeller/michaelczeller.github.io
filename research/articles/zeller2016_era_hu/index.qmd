  - <em>"In young democratic regimes like Hungary and elsewhere in the post-Soviet space, twenty-five years has proven insufficient to establish resilient democracies. Political youth has not been socialized into a healthy democratic system, and without having experienced much or any of the preceding socialist system, thus lacking that comparative frame, it significantly expresses dissatisfaction with the current regime."</em>
