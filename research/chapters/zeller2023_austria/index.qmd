## Abstract

Throughout Europe contemporary far-right activism is at least partially rooted in historical grievances and activities. Austria is no exception. Here, a far-reaching base of far-right support manifests in antisemitic and xenophobic attitudes, criminal activity, movement organisation and campaigning, and party politics. Prominent parts of the dynamics that characterise these far-right manifestations are rooted in Austria's past. This chapter focuses on that rootedness by specifying the elements of the contemporary far-right ecosystem. It looks at case of the Ulrichsberg commemorations of Third Reich military veterans and examines how that demonstration campaign is an archetype of far-right party-movement dynamics in Austria. Specifically, the commemorations long enjoyed approval, support, and even participation by prominent politicians and state officials. As the dominant perception of Austria's historical legacy shifted towards acknowledging complicity in Nazi atrocities, the Ulrichsberg commemorations became politicised and the Austrian Freedom Party (Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs, FPÖ) transformed into the political representative of Austria's far right.
