On 19 January 2021, I was a guest on the [Right Rising podcast](https://rightrising.fireside.fm/), hosted by Augusta Dell'Omo. We discussed the importance of demonstrations for far-right social movements, particularly in the wake of the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol Building on 6 January 2021. 

The podcast is available online---<https://rightrising.fireside.fm/episode13>---but also playable below.
