But the collapse of the concrete roof at Novi Sad rail station on 1 November 2024 quickly took on a symbolic dimension, epitomising the hazardous consequences of graft in the public sector. This symbol became the catalyst for a wave of [protests](https://apnews.com/article/serbia-roof-collapse-china-protests-3cfa282938b1ddec12c4795b9ecb3e95). Since the Serbian Progressive Party (*Srpska napredna stranka*, SNS) has led the Serbian government since 2012 (under President Aleksandar Vučić since 2017), protests inevitably focused on Vučić and the SNS, decrying their culpability for such public infrastructure failures.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nThe protest wave has included vigils, demonstrations, blockades, and strikes. It has triggered violent clashes (some linked to state actors), governmental reactions and concessions. (Some of these developments are represented in @fig-timeline --- but the unfolding of events is more complex.)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Timeline of events related to the protests.](index_files/figure-html/fig-timeline-1.png){#fig-timeline width=816}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAs shown in @fig-time-bar, the number of protests since November 2024 dwarfs preceding rates of protest. As of 1 February 2025, the protests have shown no signs of dissipating, with thousands of protesters continuing to demand justice and accountability for the deaths of 15 people in Novi Sad.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Number of protests by week.](index_files/figure-html/fig-time-bar-1.png){#fig-time-bar width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2024-2025 anti-corruption protests in Serbia have been characterized by widespread demonstrations and traffic blockades across the country. Data from [ACLED](https://acleddata.com/) (the **Armed Conflict Location and Event Data** Project) allows us to inspect this protest wave in greater detail. The spatial patterns of these protests have been marked by a strong presence in urban areas, with protesters often gathering in front of government buildings, universities, and other public institutions. The cities of Belgrade and Novi Sad (where the rail station roof collapse occurred) have seen the most frequent protest activity. @fig-map-regions and @fig-map-vanbaalen show that (unsurprisingly) the capital of Belgrade has seen the highest concentration of protest activity; thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the Serbian state TV building and other government institutions to demand unbiased reporting and accountability from the government. Novi Sad, the city where the railway station roof collapse occurred, has also seen significant protests, with demonstrators holding daily 15-minute traffic blockades to honour the 15 people who died in the tragedy. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Map of protests by region.](index_files/figure-html/fig-map-regions-1.png){#fig-map-regions width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Plot of protests.

The protests have also taken on a symbolic dimension, with protesters leaving red hand-prints on government buildings and using slogans like \"corruption kills\" to emphasise their demands for transparency and accountability.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Plot of protests, similar to the map in Hellmeier (2022).](index_files/figure-html/fig-map-hellmeier-1.png){#fig-map-hellmeier width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n@fig-weeks-maps-panel shows the occurrence of protests in the weeks since the anti-corruption campaign began in November 2024.

Citizens also gathered in front of various schools to support education workers who decided to strike and suspend classes nationwide to express solidarity with the students and to advocate for their demands to be addressed.&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>6<\\/td><th>tags&emsp;<\\/th><td>crowd size=no report&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><\\/table><\\/div>\",\"<div class='scrollableContainer'><table class= id='popup'><tr class='coord'><td><\\/td><th><b>Feature ID&emsp;<\\/b><\\/th><td>161&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>1<\\/td><th>country&emsp;<\\/th><td>Serbia&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>2<\\/td><th>admin1&emsp;<\\/th><td>North Backa&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>3<\\/td><th>admin2&emsp;<\\/th><td>Backa Topola&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>4<\\/td><th>location&emsp;<\\/th><td>Backa Topola&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>5<\\/td><th>notes&emsp;<\\/th><td>On 31 January 2025, around 200 citizens, education workers and high school students gathered in Backa Topola to observe 15 minutes of silence as part of the 'Serbia, Stop' campaign, to honor the victims who lost their lives following the collapse of a concrete canopy at the Novi Sad train station and demand accountability for their deaths.&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>6<\\/td><th>tags&emsp;<\\/th><td>crowd size=around 200&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><\\/table><\\/div>\",\"<div class='scrollableContainer'><table class= id='popup'><tr class='coord'><td><\\/td><th><b>Feature ID&emsp;<\\/b><\\/th><td>162&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>1<\\/td><th>country&emsp;<\\/th><td>Serbia&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>2<\\/td><th>admin1&emsp;<\\/th><td>Jablanica&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>3<\\/td><th>admin2&emsp;<\\/th><td>Leskovac&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>4<\\/td><th>location&emsp;<\\/th><td>Leskovac&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>5<\\/td><th>notes&emsp;<\\/th><td>On 31 January 2025, students, high school students, teachers, and citizens gathered in Leskovac to show support for students who have been occupying their faculties nationwide, demanding accountability for the loss of 15 lives following the collapse of a concrete canopy at the train station in Novi Sad, ultimately blaming corruption for this tragic event.

Before they entered the building they, together with several hundred citizens, observed 15 minutes of silence as part of the 'Serbia, Stop' campaign, with an aim to honor the 15 victims who lost their lives following the collapse of the concrete canopy at the Novi Sad's train station and demand accountability for this tragic event.&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>6<\\/td><th>tags&emsp;<\\/th><td>crowd size=several hundred&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><\\/table><\\/div>\",\"<div class='scrollableContainer'><table class= id='popup'><tr class='coord'><td><\\/td><th><b>Feature ID&emsp;<\\/b><\\/th><td>243&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>1<\\/td><th>country&emsp;<\\/th><td>Serbia&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>2<\\/td><th>admin1&emsp;<\\/th><td>South Backa&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>3<\\/td><th>admin2&emsp;<\\/th><td>Novi Sad&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>4<\\/td><th>location&emsp;<\\/th><td>Novi Sad&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>5<\\/td><th>notes&emsp;<\\/th><td>On 26 January 2025, citizens and students gathered in front of the City Hall in Novi Sad to honor a dog named Dona, who was killed during a previous protest blockade.

These workers believe it is inappropriate to financially benefit from the tragedy in Novi Sad, where 15 people lost their lives due to the collapse of a concrete canopy. The tragedy has sparked nationwide protests and student occupations, leading the government to become more receptive to the demands of education workers for higher salaries, which they have been advocating for several months. The striking education workers aim to support the students' demands, which include holding accountable those responsible for the 15 deaths that resulted from the infrastructure collapse at the Novi Sad railway station in November. They are also calling for an end to the prosecution of individuals arrested during previous protests and for the filing of criminal charges against those who attacked students during past demonstrations. Responses to the strike vary according to different sources. The Independent Union of Educational Workers of Serbia (Nezavisni sindikat prosvetnih radnika Srbije) reports that more than 50% of schools nationwide participated in the strike and canceled classes. In contrast, the Serbian Prime Minister claimed that over 80% of schools did not join the strike and announced that educational inspectors would be dispatched to schools in the coming days. The Minister of Education stated that nearly 90% of elementary and high schools were operating normally, with all teachers and students attending classes in 75% of them. The Forum of High Schools in Belgrade claimed that 90% of high schools in the capital joined the strike, while the Serbian President indicated that 77% of schools were operating as usual.&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>6<\\/td><th>tags&emsp;<\\/th><td>NA&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><\\/table><\\/div>\",\"<div class='scrollableContainer'><table class= id='popup'><tr class='coord'><td><\\/td><th><b>Feature ID&emsp;<\\/b><\\/th><td>371&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>1<\\/td><th>country&emsp;<\\/th><td>Serbia&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>2<\\/td><th>admin1&emsp;<\\/th><td>Raska&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>3<\\/td><th>admin2&emsp;<\\/th><td>Novi Pazar&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>4<\\/td><th>location&emsp;<\\/th><td>Novi Pazar&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>5<\\/td><th>notes&emsp;<\\/th><td>On 20 January 2025, several hundred students and citizens gathered in Novi Pazar to participate in the 'Serbia, Stop' campaign.

Their demands include the publication of documents related to the reconstruction of the Novi Sad railway station, the release and dismissal of charges against those arrested during protests, criminal charges against individuals who attacked students during these protests, and a 20% increase in funding for state universities.&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>6<\\/td><th>tags&emsp;<\\/th><td>crowd size=between 4.500 and 6.000&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><\\/table><\\/div>\",\"<div class='scrollableContainer'><table class= id='popup'><tr class='coord'><td><\\/td><th><b>Feature ID&emsp;<\\/b><\\/th><td>525&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>1<\\/td><th>country&emsp;<\\/th><td>Serbia&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>2<\\/td><th>admin1&emsp;<\\/th><td>South Backa&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>3<\\/td><th>admin2&emsp;<\\/th><td>Novi Sad&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>4<\\/td><th>location&emsp;<\\/th><td>Novi Sad&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>5<\\/td><th>notes&emsp;<\\/th><td>On 30 December 2024, students gathered in front of the City Assembly in Novi Sad demanding to attend a session to discuss their demands, and call for the dismissal of the Mayor of Novi Sad and the President of the City Assembly. Their demands include the publication of documents related to the reconstruction of the Novi Sad railway station, the release and dismissal of charges against those arrested during protests, criminal charges against individuals who attacked students during these protests, and a 20% increase in funding for state universities. After being denied entry to the building, students symbolically held their own session and observed 15 minutes of silence as part of the 'Serbia, Stop' campaign. This movement, which has been occurring throughout the country since November 22, calls for participants to pause their activities and block roads for 15 minutes to honor the 15 victims of the Novi Sad tragedy and demand accountability for their deaths. There was some pushing between police officers and opposition councilors who also attempted to enter the building. However, after being turned away, the councilors joined the students in their protest. Meanwhile, the Higher Public Prosecutor's Office filed an indictment against 13 individuals, including the former Minister of Transport and the former director of Serbian Railway Infrastructure, charging them with responsibility for the collapse of the canopy at the Novi Sad Railway Station. Students are dissatisfied with the indictment, arguing that it does not hold all responsible parties accountable, nor does it address the issue of corruption, which they believe is the primary reason for the canopy's collapse.&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>6<\\/td><th>tags&emsp;<\\/th><td>crowd size=no report&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><\\/table><\\/div>\",\"<div class='scrollableContainer'><table class= id='popup'><tr class='coord'><td><\\/td><th><b>Feature ID&emsp;<\\/b><\\/th><td>526&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>1<\\/td><th>country&emsp;<\\/th><td>Serbia&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>2<\\/td><th>admin1&emsp;<\\/th><td>Belgrade&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>3<\\/td><th>admin2&emsp;<\\/th><td>NA&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>4<\\/td><th>location&emsp;<\\/th><td>Belgrade&emsp;<\\/td><\\/tr><tr><td>5<\\/td><th>notes&emsp;<\\/th><td>On 30 December 2024, citizens and students gathered at various locations in Belgrade as part of the 'Serbia, Stop' campaign.

After the session concluded, students prevented a member of the PUPS from exiting the building. Following this, they proceeded to the 'Jovan Jovanovic Zmaj' Gymnasium to join high school students, citizens, and professors who had gathered for the 'Serbia, Stop' campaign.

The police forcibly removed the leader of the Start-Change movement, along with a local councilor from the same group, and took them to a police car for arrest. During the arrest, the Start-Change leader began to feel unwell, so he sought medical assistance. After the incident, protesters attempted to break through the police cordon which was allowing workers to begin the removal of tram tracks and asphalt. In response, activists blocked Vudro Vilson Street, thus preventing any traffic from reaching the controversial luxury residential block Belgrade waterfront, which was seen as the primary reason for the bridge's removal. The protest then briefly continued at Branko's bridge in Belgrade - Stari Grad, where between 300 and 400 activists and citizens, along with the leader of the DS blocked traffic. However, after receiving the information that the police had surrounded the protesters' camp at Old Sava bridge, about 200 participants decided to go back to that location. Police prevented between 100 and 200 protesters from crossing the bridge to reach Belgrade - Novi Beograd, where the leader of the 'The Bridge Stays' ('Most ostaje') encouraged everyone to gather and prevent the work of removal machinery. The police detained four students and activists, who were later released.

Masked men attempted to enter the City Hall, after which the police threw tear gas at the demonstrators. The clash escalated, with rioters throwing objects, baseball bats, and flares at the police, while some climbed through windows and removed or damaged the video surveillance cameras at City Hall.
