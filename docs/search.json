    "text": "I’m an Assistant Professor in comparative politics at the Geschwister-Scholl-Institut für Politikwissenschaft (GSI) at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München. I earned a Ph.D. in political science from Central European University’s Doctoral School of Political Science, Public Policy and International Relations in 2023.\nI study political violence and far-right socio-politics, as well as collaborating with colleagues on an array of topics within the area of comparative politics. My research applies a diverse array of methodological techniques, especially qualitative methods such as qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) and case study designs. I am a member of the Radicalisation Awareness Network Policy Support (RAN PS), the European Research Community on Radicalisation (ERCOR) Researchers’ Directory.\nI teach courses that deal with applied research, including Far-Right Politics and Protest, Political Violence, and Social Movements. I also teach methodological courses, such as Comparative Political Research and Case-based Methods for Social Science."

    "text": "Abstract\nScholarship on social movement lifecycles has focused on mobilization processes, with relatively less attention on the ends, demobilization. The intuitive connection between origins and ends has sometimes led to a conceptualization of demobilization as simply the failure to continue mobilizing, obscuring the distinct causal processes underlying demobilization. This article adds to recent studies foregrounding demobilization by studying the negative demobilization of large, far-right, demonstration campaigns. Using a subset from this population of cases—campaigns in Germany, England, and Austria between 1990 and 2015—the article applies qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to this causally complex phenomenon. I find that demobilizing is conjunctural, with evidence of four patterns: closing opportunity, coercive state repression, civil countermobilization, and militant anti-far-right action. This article addresses an important—and conspicuously ubiquitous—population of cases, far-right demonstration campaigns and presents findings that reflect on critical issues in the study of far-right sociopolitics."

    "text": "Abstract\nAn increasing number of countries have recently cracked down on non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Much of this crackdown is sanctioned by law and represents a bureaucratic form of repression that could indicate more severe human rights abuses in the future. This is especially the case for democracies, which unlike autocracies, may not aggressively attack civic space. We explore if crackdowns on NGOs predict broader human rights repression. Anti-NGO laws are among the most subtle means of repression and attract lesser domestic and international condemnation compared to the use of violence. Using original data on NGO repression, we test whether NGO crackdown is a predictor of political terror, and violations of physical integrity rights and civil liberties. We find that while de jure anti-NGO laws provide little information in predicting future repression, their patterns of implementation—or de facto civil society repression—predicts worsening respect for physical integrity rights and civil liberties."

    "text": "Abstract\nPoland’s transformation to democracy was not blighted by violence or intense contestation and was capped by smooth accession to the EU; the national economy developed well (though unequally) over the past three decades, including during the 2008–2009 economic crisis from which Poland emerged largely unscathed; and the ethnic and religious homogeneity of the population portended no danger of inter-group conflict. Yet Poland today is marked by strong polarisation and rising extremism. This chapter unpacks this empirical puzzle, first delineating the arc of macro-political developments that brought the populist radical right Law and Justice (PiS) party to power. Then, it identifies and classifies the variants of (violent) extremism in contemporary Poland, many of which have been nurtured or emboldened by PiS. This typological overview is accompanied by a detailed examination of one violent extremist actor, the National Radical Camp (ONR). The perils of polarisation and extremism have not gone unchallenged, so the next section identifies and classifies the types of resilience-building practices existent in Poland. This is complemented by examining the activity of the Polish ‘Autonomy Foundation’. The final section summarises the diagnosis of polarisation and extremism in Poland, as well as the prognosis suggested by political trends and resilience-building practices."

    "text": "Abstract\nCounter-mobilisation against far-right activism takes many forms, adopts many practices— but humour is one of the most persistent tactics. Time and again far-right movement organisations carry out actions laden with pretensions of gravity and solemnity: Nazis mourning Rudolf Hess on the anniversary of his suicide; Ku Klux Klan members protesting against the removal of Confederate flags from U.S. state houses; Hindu extremists ‘protecting people from immorality’ by assaulting men and women gathered together in a pub; black-clad ‘soldiers of Odin’ patrolling streets in Finland, are just a few examples. To undermine these activities, anti-fascist activists have repeatedly turned to ‘tactical frivolity’ or calculated silliness to disrupt the attempts of far-right groups to perform dignified actions. Humour can serve several purposes. In order to illustrate these, this article examines the emergence of humour as a tactic in activism in Germany and the example of the Front Deutscher Äpfel, a case which demonstrates the utility of satire among counter-mobilising activists and, specifically, against far-right groups."

    "text": "Abstract\nThis chapter gives a comprehensive overview of extremism and counter-extremism in Hungary. First, it looks at the progression of far-right social forces and the trends of resentment and xenophobic attitudes. Then, three phases of the post-socialist era are discussed, each exploring radical and extreme right political actors and movements, their political participation and influence on mainstream politics and the public. In the early years, while far-right political actors and movements proliferated, they remained marginal. With the rise of a new far-right party, Jobbik, in the 2000s, masses of voters were mobilised, and the party became the second strongest political force. Since 2010, Hungary has been marked above all by the political hegemony of Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz. The party’s turn to illiberalism and populism, and indeed its adoption of extreme positions on issues like immigration and so-called gender ideology, has closed opportunities for other far-right actors. In the final section, we examine counter-extremism policies and politics, revealing that extant measures are reactive rather than proactive and most of the time can be characterized as legally permissive and weakly implemented. What is more, since 2010 there have been no significant governmental attempts to address radicalisation, far-right activism and associated criminality."

    "text": "Abstract\nThroughout Europe contemporary far-right activism is at least partially rooted in historical grievances and activities. Austria is no exception. Here, a far-reaching base of far-right support manifests in antisemitic and xenophobic attitudes, criminal activity, movement organisation and campaigning, and party politics. Prominent parts of the dynamics that characterise these far-right manifestations are rooted in Austria’s past. This chapter focuses on that rootedness by specifying the elements of the contemporary far-right ecosystem. It looks at case of the Ulrichsberg commemorations of Third Reich military veterans and examines how that demonstration campaign is an archetype of far-right party-movement dynamics in Austria. Specifically, the commemorations long enjoyed approval, support, and even participation by prominent politicians and state officials. As the dominant perception of Austria’s historical legacy shifted towards acknowledging complicity in Nazi atrocities, the Ulrichsberg commemorations became politicised and the Austrian Freedom Party (Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs, FPÖ) transformed into the political representative of Austria’s far right."

While these measures have a wide-ranging and diverse impact, a particular effect on far-right social movements is noteworthy. Large public gatherings are widely prohibited because of the pandemic. This deprives the far right of one of its core ac- tivities: demonstrations. Far-right movements in Germany are particularly wedded to this tactic—to the extent that Fabian Virchow refers to the cen- tral importance of Demonstrationspolitik (demonstration politics) for the German far right. Considering the many uses and advantages of demon- strations, this emphasis is unsurprising."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe study of social movement organisations (SMOs) has tended to converge on the initial, upward trajectory and most intense activity of SMOs, that is, mobilisation and campaigning. Comparatively little attention has focused on the downward slope: how do movements falter and fail; how do SMOs demobilise? Recent work has sought to fill this lacuna. Davenport’s (2015) theorisation is the latest, most useful addition to the topic. Yet existing theories still omit facets of demobilisation and bear the mark of over-reliance on case inference. This article addresses these persistent conceptual problems. First, it argues for a reformulation of Davenport’s theorisation of SMO demobilisation, re-aggregating demobilising factors internal to SMOs and broadening the scope of external factors to include the repressive activities of non-state agents. Next, the article asserts that the causal logic of demobilising factors is complex: the concurrence of factors is what produces demobilisation (this is ‘conjunctural causation’) and multiple combinations of factors can cause demobilisation (this is ‘equifinality’). Finally, the article demonstrates the analytical utility of the proposed conceptual framework and concomitant causal logic by briefly analysing the case of the For Fair Elections (FFE) movement organisation in Russia in 2011-2012. This case exhibits the multiplicity of internal strains and external pressures that converge to produce demobilisation. Taken together, the article’s conceptual framework and empirical example provide a guide for identifying, analysing, and characterising SMO demobilisation."

But this abstraction can obscure the complexity of specific events and participants’ emotional motivation. What are the emotional and cognitive responses of protest participants within illiberal contexts? This article investigates this question by focusing on LGBT-rights protest participants in contemporary Poland. Using testimony from in-depth semi-structured interviews with participants from 2019 equality marches, we identify emotional and cognitive responses that centre around a quest for normalcy. Illiberal politics in Poland, especially when contrasted with perceptions about LGBT acceptance in neighbouring countries, have made everyday life ‘abnormal’, whereby LGBT individuals fear increasing violence and feel unable to act normally. Protest participation opens a space where LGBT individuals and allies can feel normal. This experience of normalcy effectively claims recognition of one’s ‘normal’ humanity. In turn, this builds resilience within participants to endure the deterring effects of everyday life and to continue their advocacy for LGBT rights."

    "text": "Abstract\nScholarship on social movement lifecycles has focused on mobilization processes, with relatively less attention on the ends, demobilization. The intuitive connection between origins and ends has sometimes led to a conceptualization of demobilization as simply the failure to continue mobilizing, obscuring the distinct causal processes underlying demobilization. This article adds to recent studies foregrounding demobilization by studying the negative demobilization of large, far-right, demonstration campaigns. Using a subset from this population of cases—campaigns in Germany, England, and Austria between 1990 and 2015—the article applies qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to this causally complex phenomenon. I find that demobilizing is conjunctural, with evidence of four patterns: closing opportunity, coercive state repression, civil countermobilization, and militant anti-far-right action. This article addresses an important—and conspicuously ubiquitous—population of cases, far-right demonstration campaigns and presents findings that reflect on critical issues in the study of far-right sociopolitics."

    "text": "Abstract\nIlliberal regimes undermine human rights norms that entail equal legal protections of citizens and social groups. Illiberal actors often intentionally drive social polarisation in hopes of bolstering their support and securing their political position. This strains liberal democratic-oriented social resilience and provokes resistance to the illiberal regime. The articles in this special issue, looking at the regimes and societies of Central and Eastern Europe—where the establishment and operation of illiberal regimes is conspicuous, where ‘pernicious polarisation’ (Somer, McCoy, & Luke, 2021) that strains social resilience is often striking, and where resistance is crucial to halt or reverse illiberalisation—address this nexus of concepts. In this introduction, we review the four key concepts that undergird the special issue’s articles."

    "text": "Abstract\nProtective measures against the spread of COVID-19 have placed strains on many segments of society, but perhaps homeless and impoverished people most of all. In Karlruhe (Germany), a form of collective action has emerged to help provide for needy individuals while their normal support structures are unavailable: ‘giving fences.’ This article reviews this practice and considers its qualities and defects. The giving fences are a promising example of solidary collective action, providing considerable advantages to participants and beneficiaries. Its shortcomings, however, emphasise the importance of resuming institutionalised social service provision as soon as emergency conditions are relaxed."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nRecent research on Islamist radicalization has directed greater attention to the conjunctions of causes and staged processes that draw individuals into violent extremism. Yet research is still grappling with the varying extents of individual action and external factors, including social networks, peer pressure, propaganda, cultural and socio-economic conditions, on radicalization processes. At bottom, this investigation revolves around the context in which individuals live and the influences acting upon them. Identifying patterns of these conditions is essential to understanding how individuals come to engage in violent extremism. This article presents a configurational analysis of foreign fighters that travelled to fight in the Syrian War. The paper presents data gathered from interviews, security and judicial records, and secondary sources on individuals from the Western Balkans (predominantly Bosnia and Herzegovina) that joined Islamist groups in the Syrian War. Individuals’ relationship with longstanding Balkan radical milieus and with key Islamist preachers were coded. Using qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) techniques, we present a systematic description of characteristics of foreign fighters."

Yet there is scant comparative work on where, how frequently, and against which right-wing extremist organization proscriptions have been applied. This article presents a new dataset on Proscribed Right-wing Extremist Organizations (PREOs) in Europe. A typology of countries’ proscriptive regimes illuminates how proscription by executive decrees is more frequent than proscription by judicial ruling, and how proscription by executive decrees appears to be more responsive to high-profile incidents of extremist violence. We complement this descriptive overview with a close investigation of patterns in Germany, the state that has most frequently used proscription against right-wing extremist organizations. Furthermore, the article presents paired case studies of the proscriptions of Blood & Honour in Germany (by executive decree) and the Nordic Resistance Movement in Finland (by judicial ruling), which point to the causal factors underlying proscription of right-wing extremist organizations."

    "title": "COVID-19 and the Pause of Far-Right Demonstrations in Germany",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In most European countries, protective measures against COVID-19 have dramatically reduced activities in public space. While these measures have wide-ranging and diverse impacts, a particular effect on far-right social movements is noteworthy. Large public gatherings are widely prohibited because of the pandemic; this deprives the far right of one of its core activities: demonstrations. Far-right movements in Germany are particularly wedded to this tactic–to the extent that Fabian Virchow refers to the central importance of Demonstrationspolitik (‘demonstration politics’) for the German far right. Considering the many uses and advantages of demonstrations, this emphasis is unsurprising.\n\nThe importance of demonstrations\nDemonstrations are, as King and Soule assert, the ‘quintessential tactic’ of social movements. Evidently, demonstrations serve several important purposes for movement organisations: raising awareness, attracting new members and keeping existing members connected, promoting group solidarity, facilitating networking. Furthermore, demonstration participants bond over the experience, typically reinforcing movement solidarity. Individually or in some permutation, these potential benefits have long recommended demonstration as an appealing tactic. Notwithstanding the expanding interest in movements within digital media, the physical presence they can muster with demonstrations remains essential (the cases of youth radicalisation in Belgium, and of Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson exemplify this). Beyond such instrumental ends, demonstrations provide meaningful references to past events, preceding mobilisations within social movements, and can fulfil other symbolic objectives. Given these myriad purposes and benefits, mobilising a large group to demonstrate is often a primary concern of movement organisers. They are exhibitions of strength and are the centre-piece of the contentious repertoire in modern society.\nDemonstration are particularly common and particularly important within the far-right movement field. Undoubtedly, demonstrations serve all or most of the instrumental purposes listed above, but for the far right symbolic motivations are perhaps even more significant. Processing down the main thoroughfare of a city or town, or convening a large rally harks back to the far right’s ‘glorious past’: the fascist regimes of the inter-war years and their mass displays of martial pomp. Nazima Kadir argues that nostalgia is an especially native element of radical social movements – she refers to the radical left, but the notion holds for the far right. By demonstrating, far-right movements boldly claim their space in the public sphere, unwilling to accept—as most far-right movements had to after the Second World War—a more furtive existence. As a result, there is typically not much internal pressure to abandon demonstration campaigns. Far-right demonstration campaigns have a common property of inertia: not tending to stop or change unless acted on by an outside force. COVID-19 undoubtedly qualifies as such an outside force; it’s an exogenous shock, a critical event, a unique demobilising pressure.\n\n\nGerman far-right demonstrations\nProscriptions against large public gatherings have halted far-right demonstrations in Germany. Even PEGIDA, which has impressively sustained a campaign of weekly demonstrations in Dresden since late 2014, was forced to suspend its (offline) activity. (PEGIDA has attempted to continue its campaign and adapt to COVID-19 restrictions by holding digital demonstrations—though something is plainly lost in this shift to virtual collective action.) But the measures against COVID-19 will eventually abate. Looking at the past decade of the German far right’s demonstration activity suggests that far-right organisations will regroup and renew their mobilisation. The figure below shows a fairly steady rate of demonstrations across quarterly periods of the year; apart from the spike of demonstrations during the refugee crisis of 2015-2016, German far-right movement organisations typically mobilise between 30 and 40 demonstrations in every three-month period. (The newspaper Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung created a cartographic visualisation of this demonstration data, available at https://interaktiv.waz.de/rechte-demos/.)\n\n\n\nNumber of far-right demonstrations in Germany in annual quarters since 2008. Note that figures from 2015 onward include ‘anti-islamification’ demonstrations by ‘GIDA’ groups. Source: Germany’s Federal Ministry of the Interior\n\n\nThe level of mobilisation, moreover, has endured through many shifts in opportunity structure. For instance, revelations in late 2011 about the terrorist activities of the so-called ‘National Socialist Underground’ spurred public outrage and state pressure against far-right entities. This plausibly explains a dip in the number of demonstrations in this period (i.e., 2011.4 and 2012.1 in the figure above). Yet Germany’s far right quickly regrouped and resumed its more typical frequency of demonstrations.\nThough it may be consequential for those who attend, participation in far-right demonstrations is generally low, not often numbering more than a few hundred. However, a handful of regular events, whether for the scale and development of the mobilisation (i.e., high and/or rising participant numbers) or for their long continuity, have acquired a noteworthy significance. Through the 2000s and 2010s, these include annual commemorations of the bombing of Dresden in the Second World War (mid-February), demonstrations on May Day, memorial marches to honour Rudolf Hess (mid-August), and processions to a Waffen-SS cemetary in Halbe (mid-November). These regular, big events stand out like mile-markers in the far-right activists’ calendar, moments to assemble, make or renew connections, and present the far-right movement in public.\nAmong the many novelties imposed by measures against COVID-19 in Germany (and around Europe), the cessation of far-right demonstration activity is conspicuous. The cacophony of marches and rallies by far-right skinheads, football hooligans, and neo-Nazis has been silenced. But this is certainly only temporary. The restoration of normal circumstances of public life and of activity in the public space will surely include renewed far-right demonstration activity. Though it may effect a pause, COVID-19 is not likely to deter the far right from their Demonstrationspolitik.\n\nOriginally published as a blog with the Centre for the Analysis of the Radical Right: https://www.radicalrightanalysis.com/2020/05/08/covid-19-and-the-pause-of-far-right-demonstrations-in-germany/"

    "text": "Counter-mobilisation against far-right activism takes many forms, adopts many practices—but humour is one of the most persistent tactics. Time and again far-right movement organisations carry out actions laden with pretensions of gravity and solemnity: Nazis mourning Rudolf Hess on the anniversary of his suicide; Ku Klux Klan members protesting against the removal of Confederate flags from U.S. state houses; Hindu extremists ‘protecting people from immorality’ by assaulting men and women gathered together in a pub; black-clad ‘soldiers of Odin’ patrolling streets in Finland, are just a few examples.\nTo undermine these activities, anti-fascist activists have repeatedly turned to ‘tactical frivolity’ or calculated silliness to disrupt the attempts of far-right groups to perform dignified actions. Some examples include converting a Nazi march route into an involuntary walkathon to raise money for anti-extremism social work; ‘mooning’ KKK members and playing comical tuba music during their march; mailing pink panties to violent Hindu conservatives; and a posse of clowns ‘protecting’ right-wing vigilante patrollers exemplify the use of japes and mockery to counter the far right.\nHumour can serve several purposes. In order to illustrate these, this article examines the emergence of humour as a tactic in activism in Germany and the example of the Front Deutscher Äpfel, a case which demonstrates the utility of satire among counter-mobilising activists and, specifically, against far-right groups.\n\nSpaßguerillas or ‘Fun fighters’\nIn the broadest terms, the use of humour by social movements serves two types of purposes: internal and external. Within movements, humour often comprises the brick and mortar of collective identity; jokes about the movement’s activism and the place of opponents helps cement cognitive, moral, and emotional connections between members. Humour also offers enhanced mobilising potential: the prospect of fun activism typically has greater appeal to potential members than more stolid activity.\nAlone, these advantages—attracting new members and promoting in-group solidarity—make humour a worthwhile attribute for social movements. But it can also serve external purposes. For example, framing opponents’ claims or stances in a humorous way subverts them, denying their legitimacy. Such ridiculing can effect a sort of ‘soft repression’ on opposing activists. It may offer greater prospects of persuading bystanders, too. Social movement activists can use humour to break out of entrenched positions and frame opponents from a more advantageous perspective. Thus, as Rachel Kutz-Flamenbaum writes:\n\nHumour is a core communicative strategy used to build affiliative ties, expand groups, strengthen communities, and attempt to educate, entertain, and persuade. In its ability to disarm and entertain, humour holds profound potential for changing people’s minds and promoting social change.\n\nIn Germany, humour became established in the panoply of social movement tactics as a response to rigid social mores and, at times, authoritarian conduct by state authorities. These same characteristics later suggested humour as a useful means to counteract far-right activism, which typically prizes traditional social norms and authoritarian leadership.\nWest Germany in the 1960s was in many ways characterised by enduring authoritarian attitudes and practices. On the one hand, the end of de-nazification drives allowed former members of Hitler’s regime to return to important positions in business and state administration in the late 1940s and early 1950s. On the other hand, anti-communism was a hegemonic precept in the West German state and society, so authorities tended to respond to leftist student activists with repression, even if the activists had no truck with the ideology represented by East Germany or the Soviet Union.\nIn this context, as Simon Teune writes, a group of activists sought ‘new forms of protest designed to overcome the limits of classic street demonstrations, characterised by distance between the public and demonstrators and by confrontation with the police.’ These were the Spaßguerillas, the ‘fun-fighters.’\nFun-fighter activists emerged from the Sozialistischen Deutschen Studentenbund (SDS, ‘German Socialist Student Union’), where some members already recognised the need for some levity to help mobilise participants and strengthen morale. Wolfgang Lefèvre, a leading figure of the SDS, wrote in 1966:\n\n‘Every event or demonstration should be inventively planned so that it is exciting and fun for students.’\n\nFun-fighters like Fritz Teufel and Rainer Langhans adopted this approach. Playful tactics—such as planning to throw pie and pudding at U.S. Vice President Hubert Humphrey, ironically supporting the partisan sensationalism of the right-wing Springer press, and making a mockery of court proceedings—could ‘mobilise young people, who could not get started with Marxist analyses and joyless demonstrations, but who still wanted to criticise the current state of affairs.’\nThey also realised it could serve instrumental purposes. While on trial for flimsy charges of incitement to violence, Teufel and Langhans took every opportunity to undermine the petty authoritarianism of the judiciary. Teufel embodied this mockery with his reluctance to stand for the judge, eventually rising only with the dismissive comment, ‘if it serves the search for truth.’\n\n\nFront Deutscher Äpfel\nLater anti-fascist activism in Germany bears the stamp of the Spaßguerillas, most notably in the imperative to make counter-action engaging to participants and observers alike. The Front Deutscher Äpfel (‘Front of German Apples’), also known as the Apfelfront, represents one type of heir to the fun-fighter legacy, embracing performative mimicry as a means of satirising the far right.\nThe Front Deutscher Äpfel was formed in 2004, after the September election to Saxony’s regional parliament (Landtag). The right-wing extremist Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands (NPD, ‘National Democratic Party of Germany’) was conspicuously successful in that election, increasing its vote share by 7.2 per cent (the biggest gain of any party) and winning 9.2 percent of the overall vote.\nInspired by the name of the regional NPD party leader, Holger Apfel, a group of artists in Leipzig organised the first Apfelfront demonstration as a response to the election as well as to the announcement of a far-right demonstration in the leftist neighbourhood of south Lepizig. Like the fun-fighters, the Apfelfront eschewed the conventional response to public far-right activism: disruptive counter-demonstrations met by varyingly suppressive police deployments. Instead, when a well-known far-right leader with connections to the NPD organised a demonstration, the Apfelfront came in traditional fascist style: black button-downs with red armbands, but with the silhouette of an apple rather than a swastika.\nGerman far-right activists typically adhere to two dictates: do not explicitly glorify the Nazi regime or display any proscribed symbols, both of which are prohibited under German law, and make a powerful show of the far-right’s mobilisation capacity. The Apfelfront undermined both these aims, comically heightening the identification with the Nazis and making a farce of the forceful far-right mobilisation with patently silly behaviour.\nDuring nearly ten years of activism the Apfelfront echoed several elements characteristic of the Nazi regime: the Apfelfront’s founder, Alf Thum, was referred to as the ‘Führer’; the Nationales Frischobst Deutschland (‘National Fresh Fruit of Germany’) was their Hitler Youth; and the Bund weicher Birnen (‘League of Soft Pears’) was their League of German Girls. (Having a ‘soft pear’ is a German idiom meaning ‘very stupid.’)\nThe Apfelfront repeatedly asserted the tenets of their fruit-based nationalism: (1) no more foreign domination of German fruit stock, (2) expel tropical fruits, (3) get rid of the false representation of history propagated by the world conspiracy of grapefruits. By parodying the Nazi regime and its far-right sympathizers, Apfelfront activists aimed to subvert legitimacy, to deny the menacing posture of the far right and instead make it an object of fun.\n\nAside from undermining the far right’s legitimacy, adopting the ‘fun-fighter approach’ serves two distinct objectives, as the case of Apfelfront clearly illustrates. First, Apfelfront antics—essentially, various forms of over-identification with xenophobic attitudes and the National Socialist regime, albeit in the realm of groceries—ease tensions in a setting fraught with the heavy antagonisms of opposed demonstrations and taut police peacekeeping deployments.\nPolice officers acknowledge this effect; many could not help but laugh when the (male) Apfelfront Führer shouted that he ‘wants to have the far-right leader’s baby.’ Apfelfront humour intentionally de-escalates the situation on the street and likely goes some way toward charming police, which might otherwise view the counter-demonstrators as aggressive troublemakers.\nYet more important is escaping the hackneyed, frequently ineffectual or even detrimental, pattern of hostile duelling demonstrations. Movements-countermovement pairs like the far right and anti-fascists often fall into modes of engagement characterised by ‘polarisation, dependency, Manichaeism, and imitation.’ Playfully imitating the far right and superficially ignoring the ‘us-them’ division disrupts these fixed patterns of antagonism. The tactics employed by the Apfelfront activists, like the fun-fighters before them, attempt to undermine their targets with ridicule.\nThe use of humour is no panacea. Tactical frivolity is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause the demobilisation of far-right groups or campaigns. But it can serve many useful purposes, which is why the approach modelled by the fun-fighters and exemplified by the Apfelfront continues to influence counter-mobilisation against the far right. In the many instances where far-right activity attempts to exhibit solemnity, gravity, or strength, a well-aimed joke is a powerful act of resistance.\n\nOriginally published as a blog with the Centre for the Analysis of the Radical Right: https://www.radicalrightanalysis.com/2020/08/06/how-to-laugh-away-the-far-right-lessons-from-germany/"

    "text": "Over the past year, far-right demonstrations have captured media attention. From several protests against COVID-19-related restrictions to disturbing episodes at national legislatures in Germany and the United States, far-right actors have proven their capability to mobilise on the street. However, these demonstrations, as indeed with many far-right protests, are rarely isolated events. They are part of wider campaigns that use demonstrations and other activities to further strategic objectives. And the quality of inertia is a common characteristic: by acquiring the cachet of ritual and tradition, far-right demonstration campaigns grow stronger as they persist. How then do these campaigns come to an end? How do they demobilise?\nIn an article recently published in Mobilization I investigate this question. Looking at large far-right demonstration campaigns in Germany, Austria, and England between 1990 and 2015 offers a useful cross-section of contexts because the strength of far-right movements vary, as do the each each government has that specifically constrain far-right activity.\n\n\n\nCountry Contexts of Demonstration Campaigns. a The country contexts in bold typeface have specific legal instruments to address far-right activism and demonstrations. Adapted from Minkenberg (2013a: 12).\n\n\nThe quarter-century from 1990 to 2015 also marks an important era for far-right activism. A rising tide of far-right mobilisation followed the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Particularly notorious is the spike of violence in Germany in the early 1990s. Similarly, the end of 2015 coincided with a shift of far-right activism in Europe. Seismic geopolitical developments–the Brexit vote, the election of Donald Trump – coincided with specific changes to the context surrounding the organised far right: in 2016 the UK banned a far-right group for the first time since World War II and across Europe the emergence of the 2015-2016 refugee crisis heralded a new era of far-right mobilisation. In total, there were 32 large far-right demonstration campaigns active in Germany, Austria, and England between 1990 and 2015.\n\nlibrary(reshape2)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ntasks &lt;- c(\"***Linzer Burschenbundball\",\"Heidenau hört zu\",\n           \"Bad Nenndorf Trauermarschen\",\"AN Antikriegstag\",\n           \"1.

Within the study, the most common pattern is marked by civil counter-mobilisation. This includes cases of social movement organisations and other non-state actors working to stop far-right campaigns. Looking at the cases covered in this grouping shows the presence of other conditions that are relevant to the demobilisation outcome. For instance, the second Hess Gedenkmarsch campaign, which occurred in the first half of the 2000s in Germany and honoured the memory of Rudolf Hess, a prominent Nazi leader, demobilised only after a new law criminalised glorification of the Nazi regime. The law was certainly spurred on by civil counter-mobilisation: residents from the location of the campaign (Wunsiedel, Germany) lobbied national politicians to adopt a prohibition ‘against Nazi glorification’ (NS Verherrlichung stoppen). In this way, civil counter-mobilisation can act as a causal trigger, setting various demobilisation processes in motion.\nThe second pattern represents coercive state repression: arrests and prosecutions, bans and proscription. In flagrant cases of illegal activity or disruption of public order the state may intervene to stop the far right. However, for campaigns that are innocuous enough to avoid state repression–eschewing blatantly fascistic displays and not inciting unrest–state repression is rare; uncommon even in Germany, where its ‘militant democracy’ (wehrhafte Demokratie) is configured to defend against the perils of far-right mobilisation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemobilisation pattern\nCases\n\n\n\n\ncivil counter-mobilisation\nAntikriegstag; Fest der Völker; HoGeSa; Lichtellaeufen Schneeberg; Mourn Lee Rigby; 2.

Wehrmachsausstellung; Bad Nenndorf Trauermarschen\n\n\n\nThe third pattern reflects a phenomenon familiar to social movement activists and researchers: closing opportunity. New laws or changes to the surrounding (enabling) context can stop or deter far-right campaigns. In Austria, for example, commemorations in Ulrichsberg used to honour Wehrmacht and SS soldiers with state support. The Austrian army participated in the ceremonies and state subsidies supported transport to the memorial site. But participation shrank dramatically to only a few hundred by 2015, after the state withdrew support and stopped the army from taking part. Notwithstanding the decisiveness of state action, non-state actors were important: the ‘Working Group against the Carinthian Consensus’ (Arbeitskreis gegen den kärntner Konsens) began problematising and counter-protesting the event several years before the national government intervened.\nThe final pattern covers cases of militant action against the far right. Non-state actors applying coercive measures—physical confrontation and violence, blockading far-right march routes or event venues, etc.—can disrupt and ultimately demobilise far-right campaigns. However, the cases representing this pattern suggest brawling, bashing, and ‘punching a fascist’ is perhaps not the most effective approach. Instead, blockades are a common and evidently powerful tactic. (Indeed, much has been written about this tactic, particularly among German activists opposing far-right groups). Some research suggests that confrontational tactics, whether blockades or more direct coercion, are counterproductive as they confirm the ‘stereotype threat’ of far-right activists. Yet militant anti-fascist activists tend to take a dim view of prospects for persuading far-right activists away from their prejudices. Rather, they assert firmly that far-right organising must be stopped. And, notwithstanding qualms and moral objections about the methods, the militant action pattern suggests that these tactics can stop the far right.\nThese patterns confirm that there are many means of demobilising the far right. Most striking, though, is the importance of non-state actors: sometimes their actions alone are enough to demobilise far-right campaigns; at other times state intervention is key, but non-state actors often spark and spur on state action. This point is especially relevant in England and Austria where, for different reasons, the state is reluctant to act against far-right demonstrations. But even in Germany, where specific legal instruments exist and political actors are often willing to use them against the far right, non-state action is vital to problematise and resist far-right campaigns. Given the resilience of far-right scenes in these countries and beyond, non-state actors must remain able and ready to counter-mobilise against far-right demonstrations that menace state and society alike.\n\nOriginally published as a blog with the Centre for the Analysis of the Radical Right: https://www.radicalrightanalysis.com/2021/10/29/how-to-demobilize-the-far-right/"

    "text": "Photo: Monument to Richard Wagner, Berlin, Germany, 08/01/2008  ArTono / Shutterstock.\nThe German far right is awash with allusion. Like elsewhere, coded communication is the rule among far-right German organizations and activists. References to old Norse myths abound, and many readers, whether from familiarity with mythology, white nationalism or Norse-inspired superhero movies, would recognize Thor’s hammer or a smattering of runic symbols like the Sigrune, the Odalrune and the Wolfsangel, all subject to specific bans in Germany. However, a less familiar but persistent presence in German far-right codes is the Nibelungenlied, a medieval epic poem long co-opted by nationalists.\nThe Nibelungenlied story centers on Siegfried, a hero in the mold of Beowulf: a strong, nearly invincible warrior who has won riches through his exploits, a powerful sword and a cloak of invisibility. Siegfried is very much the belle of the medieval bro-ball. The poem begins with Siegfried traveling to the German town of Worms to propose marriage to Kriemhild, the Burgundian princess. Her brother, King Gunther, consents to the match, but only if Siegfried helps him win the hand of Brunhild, the warrior queen of Isenland. It’s to be a double wedding.\nFollowing the nuptials (and a disturbing episode involving the marital rape of Brunhild), a feud emerges between Kriemhild and Brunhild. The conflict culminates in one of Gunther’s kinsmen murdering Siegfried, thrusting a spear into the vulnerable spot in his back. The remainder of the poem (the whole second half, that is) revolves around Kriemhild’s revenge, which results in the violent death of pretty much all the main characters, including Kriemhild herself. Taken together, the Nibelungenlied is an illuminating portrayal of ancient Germanic heroism and courtly drama.\nRediscovered in the mid-18th century, the popularity of the poem swelled with the rising tide of German nationalism in the 19th century. Most famously, the composer Richard Wagner, a German nationalist and virulent anti-Semite, reimagined the story in an epic four-part opera consisting of “The Rhinegold,” “The Valkyrie,” “Siegfried” and “Twilight of the Gods,” collectively known as “The Ring of the Nibelung” or the Ring cycle, for short. Of course, several of the operas’ leitmotifs are instantly recognizable, not least the “Ride of the Valkyries.” Wagner’s Ring cycle became a landmark of German art and is still performed today, occasionally in back-to-back-to-back-to-back marathon productions.\nThe Nazi regime was preternaturally keen to memorialize German lore, especially the Nibelungenlied, given its association with Wagner. An enthused Hitler was an honored guest in Bayreuth, home to Wagner’s own theater. Several symbols from both the original and Wagner’s version appealed to the Nazis, perhaps most notably the murder of Siegfried. It reflected the “stabbed in the back” (Dolchstoß) conspiracy theory that the Nazis propagated, namely that the German army was betrayed during the First World War by treasonous Jews and leftists.\nThe regime supported several projects stamped with the label of the Nibelungs. Chief among them was the cavernous Nibelungenhalle in Passau, the putative home of the original composer of the Nibelungenlied, which was used for mass indoor rallies. In the postwar era, far-right parties like the German People’s Union and the National Democratic Party of Germany organized assemblies with the specific intention of using the nationalist cachet of the Nibelungs — until Passau’s authorities demolished the building in 2004.\nStill, appropriation of the Nibelungs legend endures among Germany’s far right. Beginning in 2013, right-wing extremists organized the “Kampf der Nibelungen” (KdN, the “Battle of the Nibelungs”), a mixed martial arts competition catering to far-right fighters and fans from around Europe. The event attracted 850 spectators in 2018 and was one of the biggest MMA competitions in Europe. It was banned in 2019, and organizers were prevented from live-streaming KdN fights in 2020, but it may yet resurface in 2021.\nSymbols and allusions to the Nibelungenlied sadly will persist amid Germany’s far-right scene. This symbolism has a long history of co-option by extremists. Even though the chords of Wagner’s operas are not anti-Semitic, their endorsement by the Nazi regime touched Nibelung lore with an association that inescapably appeals to the far right. Yet references to the Nibelungenlied are more than far-right supporters’ fetishization of a twisted version of German cultural history. They form a part of the vast book of codes used by far-right actors to communicate. Cracking these is often the key to decoding how the far right organizes, mobilizes and ultimately understands the world in which it operates.\n\nOriginally published as a blog with the Fair Observer: https://www.fairobserver.com/region/europe/michael-c-zeller-richard-wagner-opera-nibelungenlied-nationalist-symbolism-far-right-germany-news-915421/"

    "text": "If not for the familiar awkwardness of social distancing rules, the scene at the digital party conference of Germany’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) would have been fit for a daytime game show. With the theme from “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire” playing in the background and the CDU‘s secretary-general, Paul Ziemiak, reading the results from online balloting to determine who would become the party chairman… and drive off in a brand new Volkswagen. Armin Laschet, the premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, and Friedrich Merz, a former CDU parliamentary leader, stood at one end of the TV studio. If not for coronavirus guidelines, they would have probably been holding hands, saying: I hope it’s me who wins, but I’m honored just to stand here with you.\nWith 521 of the 991 votes, Laschet was named the new CDU leader on January 16. Although the exaggerated melodrama may invite some mockery and agonized groans from readers, the designation of the new CDU leader is the first key party event before the federal elections in September, which will be pivotal for Germany’s far right.\nAngela Merkel‘s long tenure as German chancellor will draw to a close this year. After leading the country through the 2008 financial crash and the 2015 refugee crisis, Merkel will likely leave office just as Germany vaccinates most of its adult population. Germany’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic has elevated the popularity of Merkel. Similarly, polling suggests the CDU has benefited from the government’s efforts. Whereas the party polled as low as 19% (25% with its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union) in 2019, it now has upward of 30% (and as much as 37% with the CSU) of support.\n\nGermany’s Far Right\nAt the same time, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is failing to keep up. Unlike countries such as the United States where COVID-19 skeptics and conspiracy theorists have coalesced on one side of the political spectrum, in Germany, these critics have merged into broad and unexpected coalitions over the course of the crisis. Yet crucially, these coalitions have not resulted in a dealignment or realignment of party loyalties. Rather, they are short term and held together only by grievances about coronavirus restrictions. Consequently, the AfD has not gained sufficient support from these mobilizations and has slipped a couple of percentage points — from its 2017 result of 12.6% to support hovering at around 11%.\nGiven developments within the AfD over the last two years, its political stagnation is not surprising. In late 2019, a court in the eastern state of Thuringia ruled that it is not defamatory to call the AfD politician Bjorn Hocke a “fascist” as that—as was argued before the court—seems an accurate description of his politics. Further self-inflicted damage followed when the party’s leader in Brandenburg, Andreas Kalbitz, was expelled in May 2020 for previous membership in an extremist youth organization called the Heimattreue Deutsche Jugend. The party’s somewhat formalized far-right wing (Der Flugel) was classified as extremist by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV). The BfV recently moved to expand its investigation, categorizing the entire AfD as a “suspected case” of anti-constitutional activity. This designation permits close observation and monitoring of party members’ activities.\n\n\nAfD Would Lose Seats\nAll these developments, combined with an attempt by far-right extremists to invade the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, have stunted the AfD‘s growth. The party entered the Bundestag in 2017 as the third-largest faction. Subsequent polling even reported its support surged to 18% in 2018. Yet if the election were held today, the party would likely lose at least a dozen seats.\nThe question of Angela Merkel‘s successor as chancellor is not yet decided. Laschet is in poll position, but the CDU must perform well in regional elections in Baden-Wurttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate in order to repel an internal challenge from Markus Soder, the minister-president of Bavaria and leader of the CSU.\nYet regardless of that outcome, the 2021 elections look set to knock the AfD and Germany’s far right back on its heels. There is no chance of banishing it from the Bundestag, but the federal election in September could deprive the AfD of its position as the largest party of the opposition, from where its representatives’ language has been intentionally provocative and their behavior notoriously disruptive.\n\nOriginally published as a blog with the Centre for the Analysis of the Radical Right: https://www.radicalrightanalysis.com/2021/03/12/alternative-for-germany-is-failing-to-keep-up/"

    "title": "An overview of Proscribing Right-Wing Extremist Organisations in Europe",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In a recent article in Terrorism and Political Violence, co-authored with Michael Vaughan and based on data collection with over 40 country experts (listed below), I presented and offered an initial analysis of a new dataset on proscribed right-wing extremist organisations (PREOs) in Europe. The dataset (up-to-date) includes 191 proscribed organisations. A version of the dataset is availble for download on my Data page, along with further information about the proscribed organisations. The data helps to fill a gap of comparative data and analysis on responses to RWE. It is my profound hope that the data will facilitate more research in this area. Here, I will summarise the analysis put forward in the article and provide (replicable) visualisations of the data.\nAs Michael (V.) and I write in the article, violent incidents in recent years have drawn public and political attention to the threats posed by RWE. “From terrorist attacks, to extremist riots at national and regional legislatures, to the quotidian menace of RWE assault and harassment—numerous countries are simultaneously shocked by and inured to the dangers of RWE.” States, often compelled to take action by public outrage and civil society advocacy, have occasionally turned to one of militant democracy’s most severe measures to counter extremism: proscription. Yet there is a conspicuous difference in the frequency that states have resorted to this measure. “Some states have proscribed right-wing extremist (RWE) organisations quite often, while others have used proscription laws only in isolated cases; still others eschew completely such legal instruments.” Where, how frequently, against which RWE organisations, and why have proscriptions been applied? Research has not attended to this puzzle. Before delving into questions of why some organisations are proscribed, we must first establish the descriptive basis for causal questions.\nOrganisational proscription takes place in one of two ways: through executive decree or judicial ruling. Juxtaposing these two modes with the number of instances in which they have been applied, as in Table 1, reveals differences among European countries’ proscription regimes. While the extent and weight of advisory input is uncertain, we can say that the proscription by executive decree is essentially a political decision, an action authorised by a party politician acting as the head of a governmental branch (typically the interior ministry). By contrast, the judicial mode, represented on the right-hand side of Table 1, typically involves the state or governmental actors bringing suit against a RWE organisation—but a court is the authority that deems that organisation illegal.\nClose readers will notice that two countries are listed twice in Table 1. France and Hungary have applied both modes of proscription. In France, proscription typically occurs through executive decree, but two unions affiliated with the radical right Front National were outlawed by the high court partially on the basis that the unions were discriminatory. Conversely, in Hungary, court rulings have been the more common proscription mode. However, in 1994 an executive decree proscribed the Hungarian Hungarianist Movement (Magyar Hungarista Mozgalom), the first organisation proscribed in the post-communist era.\nTable 1 shows that Germany has been the state most actively proscribing RWE organisations since 1990—which should not come as a surprise—followed by France and the United Kingdom. But these proscriptions are not evenly spread throughout the last 30 years. Figure 1 shows several spikes in proscription. In France, the proscription of RWE organisations in 2013 and 2019–2022 preceded significant reductions in right-wing violence. Simultaneously, the prominence of a far-right political party (the Front National) seems to mollify some extremists and mitigate violent actions, albeit by accepting greater radicalism in the sphere of party politics. The UK, which has only recently started proscribing RWE groups, banning National Action in 2016, has been the most active state in recent years.\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggpattern)\n# remotes::install_github(\"coolbutuseless/flagon\")\n# if(!require(\"sf\")) {install.packages(\"sf\"); library(\"sf\")}\nlibrary(flagon)\n\ncountry_codes &lt;- c('at','be','bg','cz','ee','fi','fr','de','gr','hu','it','lv','nl','pl','ro','sk','si','es','gb')\n\nj &lt;- flags(country_codes, 'svg')\n\nyear &lt;- c(1990,1992,1993,1993,1994,1994,1995,1996,1997,1997,1998,1998,2000,2000,2001,2003,2004,2005,2005,2005,2006,2006,2006,2007,2008,2009,2009,2009,2009,2010,2011,2011,2012,2013,2013,2014,2014,2014,2014,2014,2015,2016,2016,2017,2019,2019,2019,2019,2019,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2020,2021,2021,2021,2022)\ncountry &lt;- c(\"Netherlands\",\"Germany\",\"Germany\",\"Italy\",\"Germany\",\"Hungary\",\"Germany\",\"Germany\",\"France\",\"Germany\",\"Germany\",\"Netherlands\",\"Germany\",\"Italy\",\"Germany\",\"Germany\",\"Belgium\",\"France\",\"Germany\",\"Hungary\",\"France\",\"Germany\",\"Slovakia\",\"Germany\",\"Germany\",\"Estonia\",\"Germany\",\"Hungary\",\"Poland\",\"Czechia\",\"Germany\",\"Spain\",\"Germany\",\"France\",\"Germany\",\"Belgium\",\"Germany\",\"Hungary\",\"Latvia\",\"Romania\",\"Germany\",\"Germany\",\"UnitedKingdom\",\"UnitedKingdom\",\"Austria\",\"France\",\"Germany\",\"Poland\",\"Slovenia\",\"Bulgaria\",\"Finland\",\"France\",\"Germany\",\"Greece\",\"UnitedKingdom\",\"France\",\"Germany\",\"UnitedKingdom\",\"France\")\nbans &lt;- c(1,4,3,3,1,1,3,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,3,1,1,1,2,2,6,5,2,1,3,1,1,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,1,3,2,1,3,1)\npreo_year_trim &lt;- data.frame(year,country,bans)\n\nif (require(\"magick\")) {\nggplot(preo_year_trim) +\n  geom_col_pattern(\n    aes(x = year, y = bans, pattern_filename = country), colour=\"black\", fill=\"gray70\",\n    pattern       = 'image',\n    pattern_type  = 'fit',\n    pattern_scale = 1\n  ) +\n  scale_pattern_filename_discrete(choices = j) +\n  scale_pattern_discrete(guide = guide_legend(nrow = 1)) +\n    theme_bw() + \n    scale_x_continuous(\"Year\", breaks = seq(1990,2022,1), minor_breaks = seq(1990,2022,1)) +\n    scale_y_continuous(\"RWE Organisations Proscribed\", breaks = seq(0,10,1), minor_breaks = seq(0,10,1)) + \n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1, size=11),\n          axis.text.y = element_text(size = 11), \n          axis.title.y = element_text(size = 11),\n          legend.text=element_text(size=11),\n          legend.title=element_blank(),\n          legend.position=\"bottom\")\n}\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

    "text": "In a recent article in Terrorism and Political Violence, co-authored with Michael Vaughan and based on data collection with over 40 country experts (listed below), I presented and offered an initial analysis of a new dataset on proscribed right-wing extremist organisations (PREOs) in Europe. The dataset (up-to-date) includes 191 proscribed organisations. A version of the dataset is availble for download on my Data page, along with further information about the proscribed organisations. The data helps to fill a gap of comparative data and analysis on responses to RWE. It is my profound hope that the data will facilitate more research in this area. Here, I will summarise the analysis put forward in the article and provide (replicable) visualisations of the data.\nAs Michael (V.) and I write in the article, violent incidents in recent years have drawn public and political attention to the threats posed by RWE. “From terrorist attacks, to extremist riots at national and regional legislatures, to the quotidian menace of RWE assault and harassment—numerous countries are simultaneously shocked by and inured to the dangers of RWE.” States, often compelled to take action by public outrage and civil society advocacy, have occasionally turned to one of militant democracy’s most severe measures to counter extremism: proscription. Yet there is a conspicuous difference in the frequency that states have resorted to this measure. “Some states have proscribed right-wing extremist (RWE) organisations quite often, while others have used proscription laws only in isolated cases; still others eschew completely such legal instruments.” Where, how frequently, against which RWE organisations, and why have proscriptions been applied?

    "title": "Hammerskins Deutschland proscribed for politics?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Yesterday, 19 September, Federal Interior Minister Nancy Faeser announced the proscription of the neo-Nazi Hammerskins Deutschland group. According to the Minister, this ban is the culmination of more than a year of preparation, involving coordination with federal and regional agencies and cooperation with American authorities. (‘Hammerskins Nation’ was founded in the United States, where it remains active.) Notwithstanding the complexity of these preparations, we should ask why the Hammerskins have been proscribed now. The group has been active in Germany for three decades. Its functions within Germany’s neo-Nazi scene, organising concerts and providing a means of networking, are largely unchanged throughout that period. The group’s size, estimated at 120 in 1999 by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, is essentially the same (now estimated at 130). And Hammerskins has not recently been connected to any major incidents that might have led to increased public demands for a ban against the group. So why now?\nIn a recent article in Terrorism and Political Violence, Michael Vaughan and I describe proscription powers, practices, and patterns around Europe. Germany belongs to a set of countries that enable the proscription of organisations through the executive, specifically through ministerial decree. This mode contrasts with countries, such as Finland, that proscribe through judicial processes. It is hard to say which of these modes is preferable and why—though Nicola McGarrity and George Williams reflect on this point—but a couple salient points are clear.\nFirst, proscription is inherently political and marked by political considerations. This is most obvious in the executive mode of proscription, where party politicians in ministerial posts exercise a discretionary power. Even in judicial processes, where legal considerations are and ought to be paramount, the role of political ‘veto players’ in agreeing to initiate a procedure is important.\nSecond, whereas proscriptions through the judiciary are open and the legal justifications are made clear in rulings, proscriptions through the executive are often opaque. In Germany, proscription decisions are announced through a ministerial press release and sometimes through a statement by the minister. Some justifications are usually offered: the group is directed against the constitutional order, or against international understanding, or its activities violate criminal laws. These are the three grounds for proscription mentioned in the Law on Associations (Vereinsgesetz). But reading these justifications and any vague substantiating evidence that the ministry offers leaves one to wonder: why now? The organisation was presumably always directed against the constitutional order, opposed to international understanding (Nazis have a bad track record when it comes to international understanding…), and operating contrary to certain laws. What element(s) additional to the legal considerations spurred on ministerial action? \nThe Hammerskins Deutschland ban was justified on all three of these grounds. Yet the group had not significantly changed since the early years of its activity in Germany; it was always directed against the constitutional order, opposed to international understanding, and operating contrary to certain laws.\nWhat’s new then? Well, Nancy Faeser is leading the Social Democratic Party (SPD) into regional elections in Hessen set for 8 October. In an advert aiming for comedy and coming only so far as comically bad, Faeser is to be seen striding down the street and acknowledging an adoring audience—setting out her stall to become Hessen’s first SPD governor (Ministerpräsident) since 1999.\nFaeser entered into her current ministerial post calling right-wing extremism the ‘greatest danger in our democracy’ and formulating an action plan to combat it:\n\nRight-wing extremism must be combated holistically—with prevention and a hard hand. The state must not wait until right-wing extremist worldviews turn into violent acts. … This also includes stopping the activities of right-wing extremist organisations that spread hate, agitation, and anti-constitutional ideas online and into our society. Where this manifests itself in structures, we will not hesitate to make use of organisational bans.\n\nIn Germany, proscription is seemingly always a plausible option for ministers. The right-wing extremist scene is large and active, with many organisations operating in contravention of the criminal code. Yet, as I show in an article currently under review, there is an underlying inconsistency in the German government’s banning practices. Organisational characteristics alone are not enough to explain which organisations get banned. Looking only at Hammerskins Deutschland’s characteristics just leads us right back to the puzzling question, why now. Situational factors are causally significant and cannot be ignored. The necessary combination of situational and organisational conditions helps not only to explain why some right-wing extremist organisations are banned but also why some are not. The crucial implication is that the practice of proscription in Germany’s militant democracy is not purely about dealing with dangerous extremist elements. It is also about politics and may even be about enhancing the political profile of a party and candidate for regional office."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Counter-mobilisation against far-right activism takes many forms, adopts many practices—but humour is one of the most persistent tactics. Time and again far-right movement organisations carry out actions laden with pretensions of gravity and solemnity: Nazis mourning Rudolf Hess on the anniversary of his suicide; Ku Klux Klan members protesting against the removal of Confederate flags from U.S. state houses; Hindu extremists ‘protecting people from immorality’ by assaulting men and women gathered together in a pub; black-clad ‘soldiers of Odin’ patrolling streets in Finland, are just a few examples.\nTo undermine these activities, anti-fascist activists have repeatedly turned to ‘tactical frivolity’ or calculated silliness to disrupt the attempts of far-right groups to perform dignified actions. Some examples include converting a Nazi march route into an involuntary walkathon to raise money for anti-extremism social work; ‘mooning’ KKK members and playing comical tuba music during their march; mailing pink panties to violent Hindu conservatives; and a posse of clowns ‘protecting’ right-wing vigilante patrollers exemplify the use of japes and mockery to counter the far right.\nHumour can serve several purposes. In order to illustrate these, this article examines the emergence of humour as a tactic in activism in Germany and the example of the Front Deutscher Äpfel, a case which demonstrates the utility of satire among counter-mobilising activists and, specifically, against far-right groups.\n\nSpaßguerillas or ‘Fun fighters’\nIn the broadest terms, the use of humour by social movements serves two types of purposes: internal and external. Within movements, humour often comprises the brick and mortar of collective identity; jokes about the movement’s activism and the place of opponents helps cement cognitive, moral, and emotional connections between members. Humour also offers enhanced mobilising potential: the prospect of fun activism typically has greater appeal to potential members than more stolid activity.\nAlone, these advantages—attracting new members and promoting in-group solidarity—make humour a worthwhile attribute for social movements. But it can also serve external purposes. For example, framing opponents’ claims or stances in a humorous way subverts them, denying their legitimacy. Such ridiculing can effect a sort of ‘soft repression’ on opposing activists. It may offer greater prospects of persuading bystanders, too. Social movement activists can use humour to break out of entrenched positions and frame opponents from a more advantageous perspective. Thus, as Rachel Kutz-Flamenbaum writes:\n\nHumour is a core communicative strategy used to build affiliative ties, expand groups, strengthen communities, and attempt to educate, entertain, and persuade. In its ability to disarm and entertain, humour holds profound potential for changing people’s minds and promoting social change.\n\nIn Germany, humour became established in the panoply of social movement tactics as a response to rigid social mores and, at times, authoritarian conduct by state authorities. These same characteristics later suggested humour as a useful means to counteract far-right activism, which typically prizes traditional social norms and authoritarian leadership.\nWest Germany in the 1960s was in many ways characterised by enduring authoritarian attitudes and practices. On the one hand, the end of de-nazification drives allowed former members of Hitler’s regime to return to important positions in business and state administration in the late 1940s and early 1950s. On the other hand, anti-communism was a hegemonic precept in the West German state and society, so authorities tended to respond to leftist student activists with repression, even if the activists had no truck with the ideology represented by East Germany or the Soviet Union.\nIn this context, as Simon Teune writes, a group of activists sought ‘new forms of protest designed to overcome the limits of classic street demonstrations, characterised by distance between the public and demonstrators and by confrontation with the police.’ These were the Spaßguerillas, the ‘fun-fighters.’\nFun-fighter activists emerged from the Sozialistischen Deutschen Studentenbund (SDS, ‘German Socialist Student Union’), where some members already recognised the need for some levity to help mobilise participants and strengthen morale. Wolfgang Lefèvre, a leading figure of the SDS, wrote in 1966:\n\n‘Every event or demonstration should be inventively planned so that it is exciting and fun for students.’\n\nFun-fighters like Fritz Teufel and Rainer Langhans adopted this approach. Playful tactics—such as planning to throw pie and pudding at U.S. Vice President Hubert Humphrey, ironically supporting the partisan sensationalism of the right-wing Springer press, and making a mockery of court proceedings—could ‘mobilise young people, who could not get started with Marxist analyses and joyless demonstrations, but who still wanted to criticise the current state of affairs.’\nThey also realised it could serve instrumental purposes. While on trial for flimsy charges of incitement to violence, Teufel and Langhans took every opportunity to undermine the petty authoritarianism of the judiciary. Teufel embodied this mockery with his reluctance to stand for the judge, eventually rising only with the dismissive comment, ‘if it serves the search for truth.’\n\n\nFront Deutscher Äpfel\nLater anti-fascist activism in Germany bears the stamp of the Spaßguerillas, most notably in the imperative to make counter-action engaging to participants and observers alike. The Front Deutscher Äpfel (‘Front of German Apples’), also known as the Apfelfront, represents one type of heir to the fun-fighter legacy, embracing performative mimicry as a means of satirising the far right.\nThe Front Deutscher Äpfel was formed in 2004, after the September election to Saxony’s regional parliament (Landtag). The right-wing extremist Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands (NPD, ‘National Democratic Party of Germany’) was conspicuously successful in that election, increasing its vote share by 7.2 per cent (the biggest gain of any party) and winning 9.2 percent of the overall vote.\nInspired by the name of the regional NPD party leader, Holger Apfel, a group of artists in Leipzig organised the first Apfelfront demonstration as a response to the election as well as to the announcement of a far-right demonstration in the leftist neighbourhood of south Lepizig. Like the fun-fighters, the Apfelfront eschewed the conventional response to public far-right activism: disruptive counter-demonstrations met by varyingly suppressive police deployments. Instead, when a well-known far-right leader with connections to the NPD organised a demonstration, the Apfelfront came in traditional fascist style: black button-downs with red armbands, but with the silhouette of an apple rather than a swastika.\nGerman far-right activists typically adhere to two dictates: do not explicitly glorify the Nazi regime or display any proscribed symbols, both of which are prohibited under German law, and make a powerful show of the far-right’s mobilisation capacity. The Apfelfront undermined both these aims, comically heightening the identification with the Nazis and making a farce of the forceful far-right mobilisation with patently silly behaviour.\nDuring nearly ten years of activism the Apfelfront echoed several elements characteristic of the Nazi regime: the Apfelfront’s founder, Alf Thum, was referred to as the ‘Führer’; the Nationales Frischobst Deutschland (‘National Fresh Fruit of Germany’) was their Hitler Youth; and the Bund weicher Birnen (‘League of Soft Pears’) was their League of German Girls. (Having a ‘soft pear’ is a German idiom meaning ‘very stupid.’)\nThe Apfelfront repeatedly asserted the tenets of their fruit-based nationalism: (1) no more foreign domination of German fruit stock, (2) expel tropical fruits, (3) get rid of the false representation of history propagated by the world conspiracy of grapefruits. By parodying the Nazi regime and its far-right sympathizers, Apfelfront activists aimed to subvert legitimacy, to deny the menacing posture of the far right and instead make it an object of fun.\n\nAside from undermining the far right’s legitimacy, adopting the ‘fun-fighter approach’ serves two distinct objectives, as the case of Apfelfront clearly illustrates. First, Apfelfront antics—essentially, various forms of over-identification with xenophobic attitudes and the National Socialist regime, albeit in the realm of groceries—ease tensions in a setting fraught with the heavy antagonisms of opposed demonstrations and taut police peacekeeping deployments.\nPolice officers acknowledge this effect; many could not help but laugh when the (male) Apfelfront Führer shouted that he ‘wants to have the far-right leader’s baby.’ Apfelfront humour intentionally de-escalates the situation on the street and likely goes some way toward charming police, which might otherwise view the counter-demonstrators as aggressive troublemakers.\nYet more important is escaping the hackneyed, frequently ineffectual or even detrimental, pattern of hostile duelling demonstrations. Movements-countermovement pairs like the far right and anti-fascists often fall into modes of engagement characterised by ‘polarisation, dependency, Manichaeism, and imitation.’ Playfully imitating the far right and superficially ignoring the ‘us-them’ division disrupts these fixed patterns of antagonism. The tactics employed by the Apfelfront activists, like the fun-fighters before them, attempt to undermine their targets with ridicule.\nThe use of humour is no panacea. Tactical frivolity is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause the demobilisation of far-right groups or campaigns. But it can serve many useful purposes, which is why the approach modelled by the fun-fighters and exemplified by the Apfelfront continues to influence counter-mobilisation against the far right. In the many instances where far-right activity attempts to exhibit solemnity, gravity, or strength, a well-aimed joke is a powerful act of resistance.\n\nOriginally published as a blog by Open Democracy: https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/countering-radical-right/how-laugh-away-far-right-lessons-germany/.

    "title": "Whither Poland? After the 2019 parliamentary elections",
    "section": "",
    "text": "On Sunday, 13 October, Poland went to the polls. These were the first parliamentary elections since 2015, when the Law & Justice (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość, or PiS) party was brought to power with the first single-party parliamentary majority since the transition from socialism. A frenetic socio-political environment, marked by recurrent sparks of political controversy, characterised the PiS government from 2015 to 2019. And Polish voters returned that government to power.\n\n\n\nPopular vote tallies by party and seat allocations in the Sejm and Senate. Source: Wybory parlamentarne 2019: Oficjalne wyniki. Gazeta Prawna.\n\n\nAnalysis of the Polish elections and forecasts of what is to come must maintain an essential fact: the PiS party retains governing authority and has been given little cause to alter its political demeanour. But this election did not go according to PiS’s plan. Despite strong economic growth (over 5 per cent in 2018), steadily declining unemployment (from 8 per cent in 2015 to just over 3 per cent currently), and both popular and economically advantageous welfare policies (most notably, 500+), PiS barely retained its majority in the Sejm (the lower house of parliament) and lost its majority in the Senate (the upper house). Among other implications, this puzzling result suggests three conclusions about the recent past and short-term future of politics in Poland.\nFirst, there was a massive rise in voter turnout at these elections. More than three million more voters participated in 2019 than in 2015, representing nearly 62 per cent of the population compared with just over 50 per cent in 2015. PiS won a greater number of votes, but so too did the main opposition, Civic Coalition (Koalicja Obywatelska, KO), as well as the Left (Lewica) party and the far-right Confederation Liberty & Independence (Konfederacja Wolność i Niepodległość, or simply ‘Konfederacja’) party. This rising tide of participation supports the view that the policies and rhetoric of PiS, sometimes strident and polarising, have mobilised previously disengaged citizens—but on both sides of the ideological divide. Along with the new voters that support the generally populist, nationalist, and conservative policies of PiS, there is growing demand for Konfederacja’s starker populist and nationalist positions. (Konfederacja received a disproportionate share of votes from young men.) At the same time, the return of Lewica to parliament is arguably symptomatic of the considerable social mobilisation against the conservative and authoritarian initiatives of PiS over the last few years.\nSecond, as a result of the greater ideological diversity represented in Poland’s parliament, the everyday conduct of politics may become less polarised. Whereas the previous legislative period was characterised by the contrast between the conservative nationalist rhetoric of PiS and the relative moderation of KO, the new period will surely witness a greater pluralism of voices among parliamentarians. The specific effect on the government’s rhetoric is not yet clear: the surge in support for Konfederacja may cause PiS to worry about its electoral flank, but the presence of Lewica and some representatives of KO gives a parliamentary presence to the thousands of demonstrators and disgruntled Poles that opposed PiS action and rhetoric on refugee, LGBT, and judiciary issues over the last four years.\nThird, this election solidifies one particularly salient policy development: the broad-based acceptance of the ‘500+’ welfare scheme. The programme, introduced over three years ago, provides 500 Polish złoty (approximately 115 Euros) per child (after the first child), per month. Initially lambasted by opposition politicians as fiscally irresponsible and an unabashed attempt to buy political support, 500+ is now virtually sacrosanct. Apart from alleviating financial burdens and providing spare disposable income—resultant rises in spending on goods and services has undoubtedly contributed to Poland’s economic growth—recipients of 500+ benefits often speak of the novel experience of not being stigmatised by receiving welfare. The scheme’s popularity and evident economic advantages compelled nearly all of the parties to pledge to maintain it.\nThe returned PiS government may meet greater institutional resistance to its agenda, particularly from the Senate, but it can plausibly assert that it has a clear mandate to continue its political programme. That means that the PiS actions, both unifying policies, like 500+, and divisive initiatives, like alteration of the judiciary and demonisation of ‘LGBT ideology,’ will likely continue apace. The 2020 Presidential election will be the first indicator of how the Polish electorate is responding to the work of the second PiS government.\n\nOriginally published as a blog by Open Democracy: https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/global-extremes/whither-poland-after-2019-parliamentary-elections/."

    "title": "Germany – Is banning far-right groups enough?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "On June 2, 2019, a far-right extremist with longstanding ties to far-right organisation Combat 18, itself long monitored by German security services, and other far-right movement organisations—shot and killed the district president of Kassel, Walter Lübcke. On October 9, 2019, another far-right figure attempted to carry out a mass shooting at a synagogue in the Saxony-Anhalt city of Halle, killing two individuals near the building. In response and because of public pressure on the government, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer’s announced a ban on Combat 18. This corresponds to a longstanding pattern in the German state’s response to far-right extremism: crises, public pressure, and spikes in far-right violence prompt bans.\nThe application of the provision of the ‘law on associations’ (Vereingesetz) that permits bans on organisations has renewed perennial debates in Germany about the ethics and efficacy of banning far-right groups. But the case of Combat 18, more so than many previous prohibitions, should prompt a wider re-examination of far-right extremism and the utility of bans.\nFigure 1 exhibits this pattern; three conspicuous waves of bans are present over the last thirty years: (1) a spate of bans were imposed in the mid-1990s following a spike of far-right violence against immigrants, refugees, and Germans of minority ethnic backgrounds; (2) several bans were imposed in 2005, coinciding with other responses to a rise in far-right mobilisation (including several large demonstrations in places like Wunsiedel, Bavaria) in the early 2000s; and (3) numerous bans were imposed in 2011-2012, propelled by revelations of far-right terrorism in the so-called ‘National Socialist Underground’ case. Here, then, is the typical pattern of the German state application of banning powers: reactive—not proactive.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 - Violent offences in Germany with a far-right background (line); number of far-right groups banned under §3 of the ‘law on associations’ (bars). Data on violent offences in 2019 are not yet available. (Figures taken from reports of the German Federal Constitutional Protection Office [Bundesverfassungsschutz].)\n\n\nWhile this might seem like an obvious trend—violence emerges and the government responds—it is certainly not the only manner of applying organisational bans. First, Germany’s justification for banning organisations is rooted in its constitution. Article 9 paragraph 2 reads, “Associations whose aims or activities contravene the criminal laws or that are directed against the constitutional order or the concept of international understanding shall be prohibited” (Art. 9 abs. 2, Grundgesetz). No inciting violent outbreak is required for the state to act. Second, what is required is evidence of violation of criminal laws (inherent to the organisation) or clear opposition to Germany’s constitutional order.\n\nThe German government’s handling of the Combat 18 ban has had many failings.\n\nIt would be curious of German authorities to claim this was not present before investigations of last year’s crimes. Combat 18 was a recognised extremist entity, mentioned in several editions of the Constitutional Protection Office’s annual reports (Bundesverfassungsschutzberichte). More importantly, it was closely connected to an already banned organisation: Blood & Honour. The extremism of this British-born group provoked a ban in 2000. Combat 18 was an avowedly weaponised off-shoot (formed in 1992), which makes the German government’s continued toleration in 2000 puzzling. Even in recent months, when the impetus to act was clear, the government has hesitated and delayed the ban of Combat 18, leading to concerns that members would have had time to prepare for raids and repressive measures against the group. Clearly, the German government’s handling of the Combat 18 ban has had many failings.\nYet Germany’s halting, hesitant response still outstrips most of its neighbours. Combat 18 originated in Britain, alongside Blood & Honour—but neither has been disrupted by any banning action there. In fact, until recently, the UK government did not pursue any organisational bans; only in 2016, applying powers of the Terrorism Act of 2000 (powers which were previously employed exclusively against Islamist groups), did the UK government ban a far-right group, ‘National Action’—the first British far-right group proscribed since the Second World War. Now is arguably an opportune moment, alongside Germany’s action, for the British government to strip Combat 18 of its right to exist in the UK. Although this is not forthcoming, it is at least somewhat heartening that British security services are devoting more resources to addressing far-right threats—but recent events lay bare the persistent shortcomings in their efforts.\nEven the UK’s slight response is preferable to inaction or—worse still—exacerbating government influence.\nIn Poland, like Germany, there are legal instruments for banning organisations if they openly oppose the values of the constitution. Such instruments are rarely used, though, and never to great effect. In 2009, the neo-fascist Oboz Narodowo-Radykalny (the ‘National Radical Camp,’ ONR, which may be familiar to observers of the large nationalist ‘Independence Day’ rally that takes place annually in November in Warsaw) was prosecuted in Brzeg and banned, but only from the Opole province.\nThe organisation re-grouped under a new registration with a centralised national hierarchy, effectively side-stepping the local ban. Subsequent legal proceedings—for instance, for burning a Jew in effigy at a demonstration in 2015, or for public statements praising Nazi collaborators in 2019—have done little if anything to deter the ONR. Instead, ONR members might well feel fortified by the actions of the governing Law and Justice (PiS) party. A former leading figure of the ONR was appointed as regional head of the ‘Institute of National Remembrance’ (Instytut Pamięci Narodowej), which is supposed to document and publicise crimes by the Nazi and communist regimes. Far from suppressing the far right, the PiS government at best eschews the threat of far-right groups—and sometimes quite decidedly shows encouragement.\n\nDespite adaptive responses by far-right movements, banning is one useful means of pushing for far-right demobilisation\n\nThe problem of far-right organisations abounds, in short, and banning orders have been sparingly and sometimes clumsily employed. To be sure, banning cannot resolve all the problems posed by far-right activism. In some cases bans are ineffective or only partially effective. And the proliferation of far-right activism and organisation on digital platforms has entailed new complexities around ban enforcement procedures. Yet as Botsch and his co-authors describe in the case of banning in Brandenburg, despite adaptive responses by far-right movements, banning is one useful means of pushing for far-right demobilisation. Bans are not a panacea; but they can be an effective remedy.\nStill, the case of Combat 18 raises one final question: why are the threats of far-right groups dealt with in a piecemeal fashion, by local and regional authorities predominantly, and occasionally by national authorities? Combat 18 is a transnational far-right group. It materialised in Britain and Germany, and is part of an international far-right extremist network. As much as any, the case of Combat 18 suggests that banning, and other means of tackling far-right extremism, should receive more multilateral attention. The action taken by the German Interior Ministry is a positive step, but more is needed.\n\nOriginally published as a blog by Open Democracy: https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/global-extremes/germany-banning-far-right-groups-enough/"

    "section": "",
    "text": "During crisis, the most serious impacts can be the result of disruptions to essential or important services creating a void that hits hardest society’s most vulnerable. Supply chains break down when they are pushed beyond capacity, or when employees are unable to go to work because of illness or due to protective measures. The selective scarcity of yeast, flour, and toilet paper in many countries’ grocery stores and the strains or temporary closures of food and service providers due to COVID-19, exemplify this breakdown.\nOftentimes, other social actors (e.g., social movements, collective action agents) step in to fill this void. At its best, this ersatz service provision can simply aid individuals and groups that are imperiled or seriously encumbered by crisis disruptions. Yet service provision during crisis or in other deprived settings can be a target for malign, ideological projects: extremists have long recognised and frequently exploited such opportunities to employ ‘community politics’—and the current COVID-19 crisis is no exception.\nExtremist actors have a long history of benefiting from crisis. Social psychological research has repeatedly confirmed a positive relationship between perceived threats—always heightened by crisis—and authoritarian attitudes. Many individuals are more inclined under crisis conditions to turn to extremist actors that portray themselves as guarantors of order and stability.\nThe Nazi party is a good case in point: in the early 1920s when Germany was gripped by hyperinflation and political instability, the Nazis and Adolf Hitler were quite popular, finding considerable responsiveness for their extremist narratives; but later, at the national election in May 1928 (i.e., before the economic crash) when Germany was more stable and prosperous, the Nazi party garnered a paltry 2.6 percent of votes; four years later, after Germany’s economy had been severely affected by the Great Depression, the Nazis won a clear majority of votes in successive elections and were nearing their seizure of absolute power.\n\nResearch has repeatedly confirmed a positive relationship between perceived threats—always heightened by crisis—and authoritarian attitudes\n\nSimilarly, when resources or services are scarce, extremists can profit by acting as community organisers and service providers. In the late 1980s in the Egyptian capital of Cairo, the militant ‘Egyptian Islamic Group’ initiated a political strategy to provide services (especially prenatal and maternity services) to an underserved and neglected slum neighbourhood. Such activity helped them gain favour in the community and went hand-in-hand with their assertion of control over local politics. In this way, the Trojan Horse of service provision smuggles extremist ideology through the gates.\nService provision comprises part of what can be termed ‘community politics.’ This refers to highly localised political action, centred around looking after the basic needs and everyday concerns of residents. Extremist actors have turned to community politics as a way of surviving and growing even without the impetus of major social crisis.\nFor example, the far-right British National Party (BNP) came to prominence in the 1980s as an extremist group focused on traditional ‘street politics’: organising marches and rallies, and terrorising minorities with gang violence. Yet militant counter-mobilisation by the Anti-Fascist Action group effectively ‘beat the BNP off the street’ by the early 1990s. Nigel Copsey describes how, faced with this robust opposition, the BNP shifted away from the street and toward community organising and outreach. This adaptation eventually led to numerous electoral gains for the BNP, making it the United Kingdoms’s most successful extremist party ever.\n\nWhen resources or services are scarce, extremists can profit by acting as community organisers and service providers\n\nCommunity politics are a powerful strategy for extremists. They transform the shouting extremist down the road into the helpful bloke knocking at the door, where extremist ideas can seem less aggressive and menacing. Times of crisis, when normal services are disrupted, are when community politics can have their most profound effect.\nThe COVID-19 crisis and its knock-on effects are an opportunity for extremists to advance their ideological projects. In many European countries, far-right extremists are using community aid projects to spread their message and recruit.\nGermany’s far-right extremists have been particularly active: members of the ‘National Democratic Party of Germany’s’ (the Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands, NPD) youth wing offer to go shopping for pensioners, help the homeless, and donate to animal shelters. ‘The Third Way’ (Der Dritte Weg), a small neo-Nazi party, has promoted its offer of neighbourhood aid alongside conspiracies about the ‘true’ origins and purpose of COVID-19, as well as advertising for planned demonstrations later in the year.\nThe peddling of extremism by providing emergency assistance is blatant, but the pressures and strains of crisis surely push several individuals to accept the help and heed the extremist ideology.\n\nIn many European countries, far-right extremists are using community aid projects to spread their message and recruit\n\nWhat can reduce and prevent the appeal of extremist community politics? The solution is demanding, but simple: greater attention has to be directed toward communities to diminish the social vulnerabilities that extremists prey upon.\nThe Marshall Plan that funded reconstruction in Germany and western Europe after the Second World War was partially motivated by the U.S. government’s intention to undermine the appeal of extremist ideologies. After repressing the Egyptian Islamic Group in the early 1990s, the Egyptian government directed more resources toward Cairo’s slums so that they would be less willing to accept extremist actors’ service provision. The BNP’s shift to community politics compelled anti-fascists to transition to community action in order to fight back against the party’s growth.\nRecent examples of counter-mobilising against extremist community politics—such as in Boxberg—show how slow and difficult this process can be. But it is the action that is required when extremists use crises and community organising campaigns to spread their toxic ideologies.\n\nOriginally published as a blog by Open Democracy: https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/global-extremes/extremists-strive-times-crisis-covid-19-pandemic-no-exception/"

    "text": "Poland is in a precarious position. Long characterised by consensual politics after the transition from communism, the country has witnessed the rise of polarisation over the last decade. The recent presidential election, decided by the slimmest of margins, splitting the country in two, is the latest epitomisation of this trend. Most troublingly, the religious and gendered character of polarisation in Poland are dimensions with which Polish society is least equipped to cope.\nIn mid-July, Poland’s incumbent President Andrzej Duda won a narrow victory that reaffirmed the ‘Law and Justice’ (PiS) party’s hold on power. Duda consistently demonised so-called ‘LGBT ideology’ and, concomitantly, promised to withdraw Poland from the Istanbul Convention, which commits signatories to prevent and combat violence against women. Duda’s campaign drew upon religious cleavages in Poland, aligning himself with the conservative Catholic Church and casting his opponent, Rafał Trzaskowski, as the face of liberal Catholics and secular Poles. This polarising strategy was reflected in the election result: a population divided (with Duda garnering 51 percent to Trzaskowski’s 49 percent) along east-west, rural-urban, and religious lines. And this poses a serious problem: polarisation is on the rise, but Poland does not have the resilience to cope with it.\nFor many years after the collapse of communism Poland’s political landscape was characterised by consensus. But consensual politics frayed in the mid-2000s and gave way to contention between two main political parties, PiS and Civic Platform. The rivalry of these two parties has fostered polarisation in Poland. Since 2015, when PiS won an outright majority in parliamentary elections and when Duda first became President, PiS has aggressively pursued its policy agenda (including troubling reforms to the judiciary, anti-abortion measures, and politically targeting LGBTQ individuals), pushing Poland’s liberal democracy toward conservative autocracy. In turn, the government’s actions have stoked the fires of polarisation.\nYet Poland is ill-equipped to fight these flames. The toolkit created by the Building Resilience to Violent Extremism (BRaVE) project compiles indicators both of polarisation and of resilience in five areas: (1) ethnicity and race, (2) religion, (3) politics, (4) gender and sexual orientation, and (5) socio-economics.\n\nPoland is among the most polarised countries in the EU along religious and gender and sexual orientation\n\nIn some of these areas, Poland’s levels of polarisation and resilience are not particularly worrying. For example, Poland has mostly below average ethnic/racial polarisation, which is not surprising given the homogeneity of the population (upwards of 95 percent ethnic Poles). Similarly, Poland has low levels of ethnic/racial resilience; it scores the lowest of 10 EU countries on fostering ‘community cohesion’ and a ‘supportive environment’ for minorities. This resilience deficiency is less concerning than if ethnic/racial polarisation was high.\nWhat about when polarisation gets ratcheted up? The PiS government has been marked by politicisation of gender equality and regression for LGBTQ Poles. Quite often, actions in these areas have been justified on political bases with few appeals to biblical canon or Catholic dogma. Nevertheless, Poland’s Catholic establishment (chiefly, the Polish Episcopal Conference) and religious conservative voters endorse and take succour from PiS’s reactionary measures. Resultantly, Poland is among the most polarised countries in the EU along religious and gender and sexual orientation dimensions.\nResilience is the ability “to face and respond to adversity, and the capacity to draw on various sources of strength and social resources to adapt and cope with challenges and situations of strain, stress or trauma”. In other words, on a societal level resilience is an attribute that helps protect against strains like polarisation. It is deeply worrying, therefore, that Poland has low levels of religious resilience and of gender and sexual orientation resilience. Precisely these areas are the ones under most strain in contemporary Poland; and Polish society does not possess much capacity to handle polarisation strains.\nEvents following President Duda’s re-election, such as the arrest of an LGBT activist and resultant protests as well as the persistence of so-called ‘LGBT free zones’ in several Polish towns, have signaled the continuation of polarisation trends. As long as PiS retains its control of governing authority—which it will do at the national level for at least three more years, until the November 2023 parliamentary elections—polarisation is a useful strategy that allows the party to pursue its conservative autocratic agenda. The liberal opponents of PiS are left to pursue resistance through collective action and to build resilience in local communities.\n\nOriginally published as a blog by Open Democracy: https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/global-extremes/poland-moving-further-towards-autocracy/."

    "title": "Requesting a letter of recommenadtion",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Through some unidentified concatenation of coincidences, I have landed in a position where I am no longer (solely) asking for letters of recommendation, but rather writing them. Outraged academics and baffled administrators are rapidly seeking a remedy to this unacceptable state of affairs, but in the meantime, I need to field requests from students, colleagues, and friends for recommendations. An acquaintance of mine, Prof. Levente Littvay, who kindly wrote a couple letters for me, provides a guide to students on requesting recommendations. Borrowing much from his advice, below are instructions about what to send me in one email so that I am informed and in a good mood when I am describing how magnificent you are to some selection committee.\nWriting letters of recommendation is part of an academic job. You should not feel hesitant about requesting one. What you should be wary of is making a confused, multi-email, short deadline request that puzzles and irritates in equal measure. Follow some simple steps to avoid that.\nFirst, give me the essential info: tell me what you are applying for. What’s the university, programme, scholarship, job, internship etc. To whom will I address the letter? Add to this the logistical information: when is the letter due (preferably, you should email me your request at least a couple weeks in advance)? Where should it be sent or how should it be submitted? Without a doubt, this is the most important information to send along. It should be at the start of your email, maybe in bold.\nSometimes the letter needs to be emailed. Sometimes they require that the email comes from my institutional email address. Sometimes the form needs to be printed and mailed. It is your job to tell me what I need to do. If there are forms (electronic or paper copy) make sure you read the form first and fill out the parts that is your job to fill out (like your full name, address, etc.); Maybe be nice and fill out my name and contact as well, so that I can focus on explaining why you are the perfect candidate for this thing.\nSecond, after providing this headline information fill in some detail. What do you want to do if your application is successful? Why would this be beneficial for you? For example…\n\nI am applying for this doctoral programme to continue research on voting for radical right parties that I started during my graduate degree. The programme is particularly attractive because it will help me build on my knowledge of qualitative methods: there is an empahsis on methods.\n\nThese two sentences have reminded me what you are interested in or working on, why you are making this application, and how some of the programme offerings will benefit you. It is brief and informative. Aim for similar concision.\nYou may be tempted to just send a link for referees or a template. That may be helpful, but don’t do only that! Please make it easier for me. Summarise. Links or templates may be useful for reference—you might also want to attach your CV—but needing to peruse these documents to figure out what is required is tiresome.\nThird, give me a few points that I might highlight about you and your application. You were in my class? Great! What did you write your essay about or what was your most impressive contribution to the course? I gave you feedback on your project? Super! Remind me about the project and maybe how it fits with what you are planning to do now. What can I write that will meaningfully capture our interaction together and enhance your application? Perhaps you have good methods skills that I can attest to; maybe you have expertise subject knowledge that you demonstrated to me. Give me an idea of what to emphasise. Be specific.\nIf you explain to me those three parts clearly and concisely, it should be no trouble for me to write you a recommendation. I will try to confirm when I have submitted the letter, but if you have not heard from me, send a reminder a few (i.e., 3 or 4) days ahead of the deadline. Just a short email: “Have you had time to submit my recommendation letter yet? Do you need anything else from me?” That will suffice for me either to confirm or else get my shit together and write the letter.\nLet’s recap what to do: send me…\n\nessential information:\n\nFor what university, programme, scholarship, job, internship is the letter needed?\nWhen is it due?\nHow should it be submitted?\n\na bit of detail:\n\nWhat will you do if your application is successful? Why?\n\ntips for what to highlight:\n\nWere you in my class? What did you contribute?\nDid I assist you on a project? Remind me.\nWhat specific points might I emphasise?\n\na reminder 3 or 4 days ahead of the deadline (if I have not already confirmed submission)\n\nFinally, in some cases, I may ask you to draft some of the letter yourself. I know, this is weird. Writing parts of your own recommendation can feel surreal. If I ask that, it means I am really pressed for time and it will be easier and quicker for me to adapt your text than wholly compose my own. Take the list of things you want me to highlight and write them up as if it was written by me. No need to be effusive in praising yourself: the substance of what you have done and how you are an ideal candidate is what matters. Don’t worry, I will be sure to add some detail about how you are a magnificent candidate.\nThat’s it! Follow this guide and I will do my best to support you and help you get whatever you are applying for.\n\nAs acknowledged above, this guide was informed by Levente Littvay’s blog on requesting recommendations: https://levente.littvay.hu/letter/."
