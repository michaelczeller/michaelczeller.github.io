<p>Concerns about corruption in the government and public institutions of Serbia have been prevalent for many years. But the collapse of the concrete roof at Novi Sad rail station on 1 November 2024 quickly took on a symbolic dimension, epitomising the hazardous consequences of graft in the public sector. This symbol became the catalyst for a wave of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/serbia-roof-collapse-china-protests-3cfa282938b1ddec12c4795b9ecb3e95">protests</a>. Since the Serbian Progressive Party (<em>Srpska napredna stranka</em>, SNS) has led the Serbian government since 2012 (under President Aleksandar Vučić since 2017), protests inevitably focused on Vučić and the SNS, decrying their culpability for such public infrastructure failures.</p>
<p>The protest wave has included vigils, demonstrations, blockades, and strikes. It has triggered violent clashes (some linked to state actors), governmental reactions and concessions. (Some of these developments are represented in <a href="#fig-timeline" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a> — but the unfolding of events is more complex.)</p>

<p>As shown in <a href="#fig-time-bar" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a>, the number of protests since November 2024 dwarfs preceding rates of protest. As of 1 February 2025, the protests have shown no signs of dissipating, with thousands of protesters continuing to demand justice and accountability for the deaths of 15 people in Novi Sad.</p>

<p>The 2024-2025 anti-corruption protests in Serbia have been characterized by widespread demonstrations and traffic blockades across the country. Data from <a href="https://acleddata.com/">ACLED</a> (the <strong>Armed Conflict Location and Event Data</strong> Project) allows us to inspect this protest wave in greater detail. The spatial patterns of these protests have been marked by a strong presence in urban areas, with protesters often gathering in front of government buildings, universities, and other public institutions. The cities of Belgrade and Novi Sad (where the rail station roof collapse occurred) have seen the most frequent protest activity. <a href="#fig-map-regions" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3</a> and <a href="#fig-map-vanbaalen" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4</a> show that (unsurprisingly) the capital of Belgrade has seen the highest concentration of protest activity; thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the Serbian state TV building and other government institutions to demand unbiased reporting and accountability from the government. Novi Sad, the city where the railway station roof collapse occurred, has also seen significant protests, with demonstrators holding daily 15-minute traffic blockades to honour the 15 people who died in the tragedy.</p>

<p>As shown in <a href="#fig-map-hellmeier" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5</a>, other cities across Serbia, including Niš, Čačak, and Kraljevo, have also experienced protests, with educators, students, and citizens demanding better working conditions, increased funding for education, and an end to government corruption. The protests have also taken on a symbolic dimension, with protesters leaving red hand-prints on government buildings and using slogans like “corruption kills” to emphasise their demands for transparency and accountability.</p>

One of the police officers has hit with a fist one of the protesters, while a 74 years old man sprayed tear gas in one of the policeman's eyes, for which he was arrested.

During the arrest, the Start-Change leader began to feel unwell, so he sought medical assistance. After the incident, protesters attempted to break through the police cordon which was allowing workers to begin the removal of tram tracks and asphalt. In response, activists blocked Vudro Vilson Street, thus preventing any traffic from reaching the controversial luxury residential block Belgrade waterfront, which was seen as the primary reason for the bridge's removal. The protest then briefly continued at Branko's bridge in Belgrade - Stari Grad, where between 300 and 400 activists and citizens, along with the leader of the DS blocked traffic. However, after receiving the information that the police had surrounded the protesters' camp at Old Sava bridge, about 200 participants decided to go back to that location. Police prevented between 100 and 200 protesters from crossing the bridge to reach Belgrade - Novi Beograd, where the leader of the 'The Bridge Stays' ('Most ostaje') encouraged everyone to gather and prevent the work of removal machinery. The police detained four students and activists, who were later released.

Others threw red paint and removed Serbian flags hanging at the entrance of the nearby ruling SNS political party premises. Some masked individuals later broke their windows using bats and threw bricks. After initial gathering in front of the railway station, demonstrators marched to the City Hall, where some demonstrators hurled rocks and paint at City Hall, breaking windows, while the councilor at the Assembly of Novi Sad released dirty water from the cistern, claiming it was faeces. Masked men attempted to enter the City Hall, after which the police threw tear gas at the demonstrators. The clash escalated, with rioters throwing objects, baseball bats, and flares at the police, while some climbed through windows and removed or damaged the video surveillance cameras at City Hall. In response, the police threw tear gas and pepper spray at the crowd. During this clash, one of the flares ignited a small fire on the ground floor. During these events, a team of reporters from N1TV Station was attacked in front of City Hall, and their camera was damaged. Videographer working for Euronews was also physically assaulted when someone violently threw him on the ground while he was recording the demonstration. The journalistic crew of the Portal 021.rs from Novi Sad was hit with plastic bottles and sprayed with paint while reporting.

<span id="cb2-15"><a href="#cb2-15" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Concerns about corruption in the government and public institutions of Serbia have been prevalent for many years. But the collapse of the concrete roof at Novi Sad rail station on 1 November 2024 quickly took on a symbolic dimension, epitomising the hazardous consequences of graft in the public sector. This symbol became the catalyst for a wave of <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">protests</span><span class="co">](https://apnews.com/article/serbia-roof-collapse-china-protests-3cfa282938b1ddec12c4795b9ecb3e95)</span>. Since the Serbian Progressive Party (*Srpska napredna stranka*, SNS) has led the Serbian government since 2012 (under President Aleksandar Vučić since 2017), protests inevitably focused on Vučić and the SNS, decrying their culpability for such public infrastructure failures.</span>

<span id="cb2-303"><a href="#cb2-303" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The 2024-2025 anti-corruption protests in Serbia have been characterized by widespread demonstrations and traffic blockades across the country. Data from <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">ACLED</span><span class="co">](https://acleddata.com/)</span> (the **Armed Conflict Location and Event Data** Project) allows us to inspect this protest wave in greater detail. The spatial patterns of these protests have been marked by a strong presence in urban areas, with protesters often gathering in front of government buildings, universities, and other public institutions. The cities of Belgrade and Novi Sad (where the rail station roof collapse occurred) have seen the most frequent protest activity. @fig-map-regions and @fig-map-vanbaalen show that (unsurprisingly) the capital of Belgrade has seen the highest concentration of protest activity; thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the Serbian state TV building and other government institutions to demand unbiased reporting and accountability from the government. Novi Sad, the city where the railway station roof collapse occurred, has also seen significant protests, with demonstrators holding daily 15-minute traffic blockades to honour the 15 people who died in the tragedy. </span>
