- title: Political Violence in Germany
  description: "This course will introduce students to the major aspects of (non-state) political violence by presenting research covering violent extremism and terrorism, radicalisation and deradicalisation, repression, demobilisation. We will consider why people and groups use political violence and how, its range of effects, how states and others react. Students will acquire both substantive knowledge of these research fields—especially through the repeated examination of important cases, such as political violence in Germany and in other countries—and the ability to evaluate research therein. Students should be prepared for reading and discussion of difficult topics, which can be unsettling."

- title: Social Movements in Germany
  description: "Social movements, long an area of inquiry in the social sciences, have attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. How and why do people engage in collective action? In what ways do they organise and mobilise? What tactics and strategies do they use? How do movements succeed—and how do they fail? This course will introduce students to the scholarship that addresses these questions. We will draw on literature about social movements generally and about specific movement cases, especially (but not exclusively) in Germany. Students will acquire detailed knowledge about the theories guiding past and present social movement research as well as expertise about specific cases of social movement activity."
